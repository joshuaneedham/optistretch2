                                <p>When I couldn't find relief from my back pain in any of the traditional (allopathic)
                                    and alternative medicine programs, I looked at things I couldn't do compared with
                                    those who had healthy backs. Complex activities were broken down to the individual
                                    muscles and muscle groups preventing me from accomplishing these activities.</p>

                                <p>Having been trained in traditional medicine I had been taught that stretching was
                                    "not effective in preventing back pain". However, I realized that if I was going to
                                    achieve these pre-determined activities, it would have to be done gradually. After
                                    accomplishing my goals and the back pain was gone, extensive investigation ensued as
                                    to why it worked from both an anatomic and pathophysiologic perspective.
                                    Opti-stretch is the composite knowledge base that ensued from this research. It is
                                    also why the program was tested for 5 years before sharing any of these
                                    findings.</p>

                                <p>I believe that Opti-stretch is founded on solid scientific theses and remains the
                                    most simple and efficient way to safely prevent the more severe forms of reoccurring
                                    back pain.</p>

                                <p>For less severe forms of reoccurring back pain, there are some very good programs
                                    which have been developed.</p>

                                <p>I would agree. Back pain has been described since the beginning of man. Even with the
                                    advent of modern medicine in the 17th and 18th centuries no other malady has been so
                                    controversial. Even new scientific disciplines have broken away from traditional
                                    medicine (i.e. Osteopathy and Chiropractory). Several hundreds of other programs and
                                    inventions exist. Never-the-less in the 21st century, the cause of Benign Back Pain
                                    is considered a scientific enigma despite thousands of theories, researchers and
                                    scientific papers. In 2009 most medical schools still teach that although enigmatic,
                                    it remains a self limiting disease process due to muscle strain of poorly understood
                                    muscles or muscle groups which then resolves usually after the age of 60. This is
                                    also the age when heavy lifting is decreased and back pain commonly attributed to
                                    osteoarthritic changes. No treatment at all has shown just as effective as the most
                                    advanced medicines and programs known. Still it remains nearly a trillion dollar
                                    annual drain on the US economy and has a severe negative effect on the activity
                                    level of millions.</p>

                                <p>Any scientist will tell you that by answering a single question gives rise to dozens
                                    of other questions. </p>

                                <p>To paraphrase Einstein, complex theories should be able to be reduced to a simple
                                    easily understood mathematical equation. Translated into medical science, complex
                                    medical theories have to be built upon simple physiologic facts.</p>

                                <p>This genetically programmed activity of the human body is seldom addressed. The
                                    activity is very similar to yawning. Both yawning and involuntary stretching are
                                    poorly understood in science as their purpose in every non-aquatic mammal on
                                    earth.</p>

                                <p>In yawning the mouth and jaw go through a characteristic extreme range-of-motion
                                    (ROM). Involuntary stretching the low back moves forward, the shoulders back. Arm
                                    movement is quit variable for individuals. Usually either both arms are extended
                                    above the head and slightly backwards, or one arm extends upward while the other
                                    down and backwards.</p>

                                <p>This rather extreme ROM is comfortable and even refreshing if performed
                                    involuntarily. However, to try to achieve this precise ROM is quite uncomfortable.
                                    Presumably this is due to not only active contraction of specific muscles but active
                                    relaxation of others during the involuntary stretch.</p>

                                <p><strong>Onset in-utero</strong></p>

                                <p>Onset of involuntary stretching begins in-utero. By birth this phenomenon is
                                    remarkably similar for every healthy infant.</p>

                                <p><strong>Aquatic mammals</strong></p>

                                <p>Aquatic mammals do not display activity. Presumably it is because marine mammals
                                    never stop moving for long periods throughout their life. These mammals even swim in
                                    their sleep.</p>

                                <p><strong>Quiescent during injury and sickness</strong></p>

                                <p>During significant injury and sickness this activity is not observed.</p>

                                <p>This concept is not a new concept. It is refers to the musculature of the spine and
                                    central axis of the body. What is new is that these muscles somewhat different
                                    physiologic properties compared to the peripheral muscles of the body.</p>

                                <p>The current medical concept is that muscle strain will heal to 100% following injury.
                                    While this is true for peripheral muscles it is not true for core muscles. The
                                    reason is that in the core muscles there are multiple groups of muscles which
                                    perform the same anatomic function. More powerful muscles are able maintain
                                    essential anatomic movement while weaker musculature can be prevented from healing
                                    completely. This allows for the formation of asymptomatic chronically injured
                                    muscles (ACISMS). These chronically injured muscles when stressed easily become
                                    reinjured setting up a vicious cycle of reoccurring strains. This causes the
                                    phenomenon of recurrent strain syndromes.</p>
