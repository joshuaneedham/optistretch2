                                    back is
                                    extremely important. Opti-stretch provides valuable information for both those with
                                    back
                                    pain reoccurring more than once in the same location and to athletic individuals
                                    with little
                                    or no back pain.</p>

                                <p>Opti-stretch is goal oriented. For those with a history of back pain, first perform
                                    the
                                    screening exam. If risk factors are detected, proceed to Level 1 of the Opti-stretch
                                    challenge.</p>

                                <p>For athletic individuals and Dr. Moms, simply read the knowledge base and see if it
                                    may
                                    contain helpful information in your individual goals for you or your child.</p>

                                <h3>REOCCURING BACK PAIN. HOW IS IT DEFINED?</h3>

                                <p>Reoccurring back pain is pain that occurs in the same location more than once. Back
                                    pain that
                                    occurs once and doesn't reoccur for another 5 years is generally not a problem.
                                    However,
                                    back pain reoccurring in the exact same location 3 or 4 times a year is a
                                    significant
                                    problem for many individuals.</p>

                                <p>A major breakthrough is the ability to assign a level to your back pain and
                                    objectively
                                    compare it with others. For any given incident of back strain, the level of pain is
                                    valuable. However, a more important indicator is amount of time it takes for the
                                    pain to
                                    disappear and for the individual to return to normal activity.</p>

                                <p>Using a Degree 1 to 4 system is simple but also valuable for research. Think of it as
                                    classifying a burn.</p>

                                <p>There 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree. Clinically there is a 4th degree burn (requiring deep
                                    tissue
                                    debridement).</p>

                                    <li>*Pain severity in Degrees 1st and 3rd can be highly variable.</li>

                                        resolved.

                                    <li>Using this system, it is easy to assign a level to your type of back pain and

                                <p>Incapacity: Another important distinction is whether there is any incapacity after
                                    healing.
                                    Most commonly after a 4th Degree strain an individual will say that their back never
                                    felt
                                    the same again. Many "religiously avoid lifting heavy objects" or if they do lift
                                    heavy
                                    objects they are "continually aware of body position while lifting so as not to
                                    strain the
                                    back again".</p>

                                <p>"No incapacity" suggests the individual can comfortably lift an object off the ground
                                    1.0 to
                                    1.5 times their own ideal body weight,</p>

                                <p>4th Degree: Is of particular interest.</p>

                                <p>For the first 5 days the pain is so severe and unrelenting that if you have ever
                                    experienced
                                    it, you will remember it. The severity of pain is very similar to having a broken
                                    bone.
                                    Classic descriptions are that "it takes an extra 10 minutes just to put on my
                                    shoes". "Once
                                    I find a semi-comfortable position, I have to think twice whether it is even worth
                                    getting
                                    up to go to the bathroom." Only 1 in 100 individuals to 1 in 300 will experience
                                    this type
                                    of strain. It only occurs in the low back. The pain encompasses the entire low back
                                    at
                                    first. After 2-4 weeks of healing, the pain then gradually localizes over the left
                                    or right
                                    posterior superior iliac spine (boney prominence 3 fingerbreadths from the middle of
                                    the
                                    spine at the level of the belt-line [see home page figure 1]). Many report that a
                                    simple
                                    twisting motion can cause this type of strain. Commonly the individual will describe
                                    that
                                    their "back never felt the same" after the first occurrence. After several strains,
                                    many
                                    self impose a strict limitation on their lifting of heavy objects and certain other
                                    activities. Doing this, they find they can go for prolonged time periods without
                                    another
                                    strain. Given that activity is "a spice of life", this tremendously negative effect
                                    on the
                                    quality of life is a needless tragedy for many. Until they regain their healthy
                                    strain-resistant back they sometimes don't even realize how much of life they were
                                    missing.
                                    Opti-stretch was specifically designed for this type of individual.</p>

                                <p>A major goal is to utilize stretching to determine whether muscles are healthy or
                                    whether
                                    some type of chronic injury is present. Traditional medicine teaches that following
                                    strain,
                                    muscles will heal to 100%. This does apply to peripheral muscles. However, in the
                                    core
                                    muscles where both stronger and weaker muscle groups performsimilar functions, the
                                    weaker
                                    muscles in certain body types can remain in a state of chronic injury for decades.
                                    These
                                    muscle groups are extremely susceptible to reinjury thus causing reoccurring strain
                                    problems. If present, they are essentially asymptomatic (unless directly assessed).
                                    The term
                                    "asymptomatic chronically injured muscles" (ACIMS) has been coined.</p>

                                <p>Not only the primarily injured muscles display the properties of ACIMS but so do
                                    other more
                                    remote muscle groups which have presumably gone into a partial spasm state to
                                    preserve the
                                    essential functional capacity of the body. These secondary ACIMS must be corrected
                                    before
                                    primary ACIMS can be completely returned to health.</p>

                                <p><strong>Properties of ACIMS</strong></p>

                                <p>There are four classic properties which ACIMS display referred to as "the 4-T's".</p>

                                <p>Consider completing level 2 of the Opti-stretch program.</p>

                                <p><strong>Strengthen - the back muscles</strong></p>

                                <p>Opti-stretch does have a simple strengthening program. However, many of the exercises
                                    are
                                    considered by traditional medicine to be associated with back pain. Therefore, the
                                    program
                                    is shared with those who have completed the program.</p>

                                <p><strong>Condition - the back muscles</strong></p>

                                <p>With healthy and strong muscles, the sky is the limit. There are many good programs
                                    out there
                                    for conditioning. (Remember, Opti-stretch is useful in making sure that you are not
                                    over-stressing the muscles with your conditioning program. [See Program for
                                    Athletes])</p>

                                <p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>

                                <p>The ultimate goal of Opti-stretch is to establish a level of activity which allows
                                    for
                                    maintaining all of the muscles of the back in a healthy state (i.e. rock climbing,
                                    triathlons, martial arts, etc.) Using the Opti-stretch screening program the health
                                    of the
                                    back can be checked initially every week for several months. If the muscles are
                                    remaining
                                    healthy the screening program needs to be performed at least once a month to ensure
                                    that no
                                    chronically injured muscles are starting to develop.</p>

                                <p>If an injury happens to occur, the Opti-stretch warm-up program can be utilized to
                                    help heal
                                    the injury as rapidly as possible. When the back has returned to normal, the
                                    screening
                                    program is performed to ensure the injury has healed completely.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Other important concepts</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>

                                <p>Many studies have shown that back pain occurs in about the same frequency for
                                    individuals who
                                    are extremely flexible and those who are not very flexible. Hyperflexible
                                    individuals with
                                    back pain exhibit similar asymmetry and (ACIMS) as other individuals with back
                                    pain.</p>

                                <p>Opti-stretch research has shown that expected relative flexibility can be estimated
                                    by
                                    assessing which joints are double-jointed (a.k.a. joint hyperflexibility or
                                    extensibility).
                                    Four groups exist: no doubled jointedness, 1st degree (thumb or finger), 2nd degree
                                    (elbow),
                                    3rd degree (knee or hip) and 4th degree (spine). With increasing joint size
                                    double-jointedness the expected relative flexibility increases.</p>

                                <p>This is very valuable information when assessing and comparing individuals.</p>

                                <p>Seldom are these different levels of hyperflexibility see before 6 years of age.</p>


                                <h3>Common Locations</h3>

                                <p>These are the most common reoccurring muscle strain locations in 4000 individuals and
                                    where
                                    Opti-stretch has been demonstrated to be extremely helpful. A complete and detailed
                                    description is beyond the scope of this website. Only a brief introduction for
                                    reference
                                    purposes is presented. (A more detailed description is found in "Opti-stretch versus
                                    Recurrent Back Pain". There is a great deal of additional information which has not
                                    yet been
                                    published.)</p>


                                <p><strong>Low Back</strong></p>

                                <p>Button 1 shows the location of the most frequent and most incapacitating area of low
                                    back
                                    pain known. Remember, this location is after several weeks of healing. Acutely, the
                                    severe
                                    pain involves the entire low back area. There are 5 different types of this problem.
                                    Briefly, the most severe worst-of-the-worst strain problem known to man is
                                    right-sided
                                    ipsilateral (same side) asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMS). A less
                                    severe
                                    problem is left-sided ipsilateral ACIMS. Two other types are seen where
                                    contralateral
                                    (opposite side) ACIMS form. This constitutes a less severe form of the problem. A
                                    5th type
                                    is reserved for the few individuals not fitting into the above mentioned types. The
                                    primary
                                    muscle strain involves the iliopsoas complex.</p>

                                <p>Button 3 is also a very common location for muscle strain of the erector spinae
                                    muscles. This
                                    is frequently seen in Level 1 form in blue collar labors experiencing a particularly
                                    demanding day working in a bend over position which they are not accustomed. Level 2
                                    and 3
                                    is commonly seen in "weekend warriors" and others with poorly conditioned erector
                                    spinae
                                    muscles.</p>

                                <p><strong>Hip</strong></p>

                                <p>Button 6 is a location frequently seen in females. It can be a serious problem and is
                                    analogous to the button 1 area in males. In its most acute form it can be mistaken
                                    for a hip
                                    bursitis.</p>

                                <p><strong>Upper low back</strong></p>

                                <p>Button 4 location is not extremely common. Frequently involves the quadratus lumborum
                                    muscle
                                    and\or multifidus musculature.</p>

                                <p><strong>Upper back</strong></p>

                                <p>Button 5 is the most common upper back problem area. It primarily involves the
                                    rhomboids
                                    which are difficult to stretch. Isometric exercises are important in returning the
                                    muscles
                                    to a healthy state. If low back ACIMS exist, these must be corrected first before
                                    any long
                                    term correction can be expected.</p>

                                <p><strong>Neck and upper shoulders</strong></p>

                                <p>Button 6 is the most common location of the shoulder and neck area. The levator
                                    scapulae and
                                    trapezius muscles are primarily involved. Two new stretches have been included in
                                    the
                                    Opti-stretch Upper Back Program for this area. Assessment and correction of low back
                                    ACIMS
                                    is again important.</p>

                                <p>Button 7 generally involves the rotational muscle of the neck. Again, for long term
                                    results,
                                    low back and upper back ACIMS must be corrected if present to achieve any long

                                <p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>

                                <p>The human body is most flexible at birth. Flexibility decreases during the first year
                                    of
                                    life. Virtually all healthy 3 to 5 year olds have the same flexibility. This level
                                    of
                                    flexibility is also very common in adults who have no history of back pain (and no

                                    hyperflexibility). For this reason the level of flexibility at ages 3 to 5 has been
                                    determined the "gold standard of range-of-motion".</p>

                                <p>By age 6, hyperflexibility subtypes start to appear, as-well-as limitations of
                                    range-of-motion.</p>

                                <p>While many individuals with healthy backs and no history of back pain have
                                    significantly less
                                    range-of-motion than the "gold standard", Opti-stretch has determined that there is
                                    a
                                    minimum range-of-motion that needs to exist in order for an individual to both lift
                                    heavy
                                    objects and maintain a healthy back throughout life. (Details in the book
                                    "Opti-stretch

                                <p><strong>Injury</strong></p>

                                <p>Most healthy children will have some type of bumps and bruises as they develop. The
                                    screening
                                    program is valuable in determining when the child or adolescent is ready for full
                                    activity.</p>

                                <p>Frequently we have encountered significant asymmetry in children who have suffered a
                                    fairly
                                    serious injury to that limb in the past. Knowledge of the range-of-motion prior to a
                                    serious
                                    accident will allow parents to determine if the injury has completely healed or
                                    whether the
                                    child needs to be reevaluated by their pediatrician. This allows optimum healing of
                                    any
                                    significant injury.</p>


                                <p><strong>Assessing new activity regimens (i.e. martial arts)</strong></p>

                                <p>Many activities such as martial arts, dance team, and others require a certain
                                    extreme
                                    range-of-motion. While this is generally regarded as healthy, it is important for
                                    parents to
                                    periodically assess that asymmetry is not developing in their child. If asymmetry is
                                    occurring, the risk of muscle strain and other injuries increase substantially.</p>

                                <p>Many studies on range-of-motion have determined that a certain amount of increased
                                    range-of
                                    motion is normal for overused dominant limbs (i.e. base-ball pitchers, kickers,
                                    carpenters,
                                    etc.). Rarely does this exceed 1 inch of range-of-motion increase. Also the
                                    non-dominant
                                    limb has a normal "stretch-to-pain" transition.</p>

                                <p><strong>Warming up muscles!</strong>

                                <p>The value of warming up muscle is quite controversial in the literature. First, the
                                    most
                                    important protection from muscle injury is having healthy strain resistant muscles
                                    to start
                                    with. Second, adrenaline significantly protects muscles from injury. This is why
                                    muscles are
                                    seldom injured during a true emergency activity. Third, as the body ages, the more
                                    important
                                    a good warm-up routine is. Therefore, learning routines while young is of
                                    significant value.
                                    Stretching is only one of many effective ways to warm up the muscles. Many team
                                    sports have
                                    a standard routine. At home, you can first perform the team standard routine and
                                    then the
                                    Opti-stretch warm-up afterwards to see whether all the muscles groups are
                                    sufficiently
                                    warmed up. Many have different warm-ups for different activities. As mentioned
                                    previously,
                                    the Opti-stretch warm-up can be used as a "gold standard" for comparing various
                                    routines.
                                    Depending on your body type you may need to incorporate a couple more warm-ups,
                                    especially
                                    if you have any non-correctable body asymmetries.</p>

                                <p><strong>How long does a warm-up last?</strong>

                                <p>This varies on age. For adolescents and adults under age 45 an "involuntary stretch"
                                    is
                                    adequate in the morning and lasts throughout the day until 2 hours or more of
                                    inactivity
                                    (i.e. a nap or prolonged car ride). If you are getting to an age where a 2 or more
                                    hour car
                                    ride makes you a little stiff, warm-ups before strenuous physical activity should
                                    strongly
                                    be considered.</p>

                                <p><strong>Stretching exercise.</strong>

                                <p>At last count, there are over 1,500 different stretches which have been published.
                                    There are
                                    approximately 656 muscles of the human body. I have reviewed over 150 different
                                    stretching
                                    programs (i.e. Yoga, Pilates, etc.). The stretches used by Opti-stretch (especially
                                    for the
                                    low back) have been carefully chosen for optimizing the warm-up of muscles required
                                    to lift
                                    heavy objects.</p>

                                <p><strong>Overstressing the muscles?</strong>

                                <p>Athletes can overstress muscles if their exercise routine is too demanding. This can
                                    lead to
                                    minor injury which can stall progress. You can periodically assess new routines by
                                    using a
                                    before-and-after comparison of either the Opti-stretch screening program or the
                                    Opti-stretch
                                    warm-up program. Significantly decreased ROM after an exercise routine may suggest
                                    too
                                    intense of routine. A more rapid improvement may be achieved by a more gradual
                                    increase in
                                    your routine intensity. Cooling down the muscles is highly recommended by many
                                    athletic
                                    trainers. The Opti-stretch warm-up routine is both valuable and can provide
                                    additional
                                    information regarding the work-out.</p>

                                <p><strong>Assessing for muscle injury?</strong>

                                <p>First sensation-of-stretch is a very valuable tool. If the 1st sensation has
                                    decreased, the
                                    chance of a significant injury has occurred. By pushing a strained muscle, the
                                    chance of a
                                    more serious strain occurring is increased dramatically. Everyone knows that if you
                                    move a
                                    muscle and you have pain, most likely an injury has occurred. What Opti-stretch has
                                    discovered is that even subtle shortening of the stretch-to-pain transition also
                                    indicates
                                    some type of injury has occurred.</p>

                                <p><strong>Return to 100% activity following injury. When?</strong>

                                <p>The 1st sensation of stretch has returned to normal and Opti-stretch warm-up shows
                                    symmetrical 2 inch increases in both sides of the body before engaging in 100%
                                    activity.</p>

                                <p><strong>Deep muscle massage! How to give yourself one!</strong>

                                <p>Deep muscle massage is a commonly employed by many professional athletes. This can be
                                    rather
                                    expensive for the average individual. By slowly and gently performing the
                                    Opti-stretch
                                    warm-up, you will achieve the same level of muscle relaxation and benefits for a
                                    fraction of
                                    the cost. Many find this a great stress reducer prior to bed.</p>

                                <p><strong>Determining proper activity level!</strong>

                                <p>Peak age of muscular performance is considered to be around ages 20-25. Your own
                                    individual
                                    optimal range-of-motion for your body type is generally at this age also. Many
                                    athletic
                                    individuals will continue this range-of-motion (ROM) into their 70's. Remember,
                                    optimum
                                    stretched ROM is different for different hyperflexibility body types.</p>

                                <p><strong>Fountain of Youth</strong>

                                <p>While there are many hallmarks of aging, a major indicator is range-of-motion. It
                                    always
                                    tends to decrease with advanced age. Above-average active individuals generally
                                    preserve an
                                    increased range-of-motion well into their 80's and 90's. "Spry" individuals at these
                                    ages
                                    tend to be more active and healthy. Studies in the literature suggest that increased
                                    range-of-motion at advanced ages decreases the incidence of falling and appears to
                                    be a good
                                    indicator of above average health.</p>
