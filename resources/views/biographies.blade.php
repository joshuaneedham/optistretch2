    					<p class="article-start">Benign back pain due to muscle strain is a very complex subject. As the second leading cause of physician visits, it has been a highly investigated subject in medicine for the past 300 years with multiple thousands of investigators researching a remedy. While at the time it did not seem fortuitous, my knowledge base accrued over the past 34 years has allowed me to look at the subject from multiple different perspectives. </p>
				        <p>As an orderly, I changed the weights on the traction devices used for treating acute back strain. It proved a remedy both ineffective and highly cost prohibitive. Working as an ER orderly I got my first taste of the quantity of back pain seen through an Emergency Room. I secured a job as a Physical Therapy Assistant with extensive weekend responsibilities. While catching a 250 pound patient while falling, I sustained a back strain which plagued me for the next 20 years.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Masters degree in Zoology with an emphasis on comparative anatomy and physiology.</li>
							<li>General surgery for 3 years with extensive orthopedic and neurosurgical training.</li>
							<li>ER medicine for 7 years in both major and small hospitals, with another 2,500 hours in Urgent Care Medicine with on site physical therapy.</li>
							<li>Anesthesiology residency and Fellowship in Pain Management at Texas Tech University Hospital. Interim director of Pain Management at OHSU University Hospital and concomitant staff anesthesiologist for 3 years.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>While at OHSU serving as Interim Director of Pain Management our department worked closely with the Neurosurgery Department for maximum treatment of chronic pain patients. When stating I would research a certain subject, a wise Neurosurgeon looked me in the eyes and stated "we are the experts". Shortly thereafter while lifting my 35 pound daughter above my head, I again strained my back for the umpteenth thousandth time. I vowed to research "everything" known about back pain due to muscle strain. Opti-stretch is the result of the past 13 years of research. Over the past 13 years of research I have worked as a general laborer, roofer, and construction worker. Opti-stretch has been invaluable while lifting 300 pound objects. I sincerely hope this knowledge base will prove equally as valuable to you.</p>
						<p>Best of luck in finding a solution for achieving and maintaining a healthy strain resistant back for life. Opti-stretch can be helpful.</p>

						<p class="article-start">Opti-Stretch versus Recurrent Back Pain class instructor for nine years and General Manager of Opti-Stretch. Trained and taught with Dr. Neil, M.D.</p>
						<p>Graduated from Weber State University with a B.S. in Heath Promotion, CHES (Certified Health Education Specialist) and ACSM Certified Group Exercise Instructor. </p>
						<p>An exciting part of teaching Opti-stretch is having former students recognize me on the street as 'the Opti-stretch lady". Many students have thanked me for how much OPTI-STRETCH has changed their lives by either getting rid of their back pain or at least making it more manageable. Although Opti-stretch is new and small, I believe the program has a tremendous potential for helping many people.</p>
