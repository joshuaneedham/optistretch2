					<p>Breathe in.</p>
					<p>Slowly and cautiously proceed to a second sensation of stretch in the muscles. This is often the beginning of moderate discomfort of stretch and is generally a safe range that you can work in.</p>

					the muscles.</p>

					Opti-stretch 1 mild, moderate or greater.) Inhale over 2 seconds while
					relaxing the stretch 1/2 inch. (If this level of stretch intensity
					is moderately uncomfortable, relax the stretch completely and
					start the subset again.)</p>
					<p>Repeat as Subset 1 and 2, except during <u>And*-ex</u>. Take in
					only a very small breath (or even better, none at all). Then
					exhale totally by contracting the chest wall muscles to force
					out the residual volume. <u><b>Remember</b></u> to never exceed 1 inch
					of additional range of motion. Then slowly relax the stretch
					completely. Repeat 3 times.</p></td>
