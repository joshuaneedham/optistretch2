    <p>a. &nbsp;In the standing or sitting position, turn the head to the left by approximately 45 degrees. The head
        should still be in an upright position.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Using the right hand or both hands, gently pull the head so the right ear is moving in the direction of
        the right armpit (axilla).</p>

    <p>Notes: This is a very sensitive stretch. It must be performed in a very slow and careful manner so as to avoid
        injury.</p>

    <p>Risk Factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This stretch is difficult to measure. However, if one side feels tighter than the other, this is considered
            a risk factor.
        </li>
