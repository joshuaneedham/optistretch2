<h3>9. HYPERFLEXIBILITY AND DOUBLE - JOINTEDNESS</h3>
<p>
    Literally, hyperflexibility implies greater flexibility than the average individual. Hyperflexibility is also a term
    often used to describe double-jointed individuals. Double-jointed individuals (who actually demonstrate true joint
    hyperextensibility) do tend to be more flexible.
</p>

<p>
    To extend the arm, you simply straighten your arm. A double-jointed individual not only can straighten the arm out,
    but they can bend it backwards a little ways.
</p>

<p>
    If all forms of double-jointedness are considered, including thumb hyperextensibility, the condition is extremely
    common. Roughly 10 to 20 percent of the population have some measurable hyperextensibility of at least one joint.
    This suggests that between 10 and 20 percent of the population have some degree of genetic hyperflexibility . This
    is usually seen more often in females.
</p>

<p>
    Remember, this 20 percent of the population are not same 20 percent in the “never any back pain” group. As mentioned
    earlier, for centuries it has been known that the more
    flexible the individual, does not necessarily mean the less back problems the individual will have. In fact,
    hyperflexible individuals often suffer very significantly from recurrent back strain problems.
</p>

<p>
    In order to help this group of hyperflexible individuals, it is important to first be able to recognize the group.
    For simplicity, Opti-stretch has utilized a very basic screening process than can identify individuals who display
    some amount of genetic hyperextensibility. Opti-stretch simply looks for small, medium and large joint
    hyperextensibility. The larger the joint which is hyperextensible, the more the general amount of hyperflexibility
    that is seen between ages 6 and 45. Over age 55 there appears to be less of a correlation. Many senior citizens with
    demonstrable joint hyperextensibility actually tend to be similar or even less flexible than the general population.
</p>

<p>
    Below, are listed the four degrees of genetic hyperextensibility. Also listed are the corresponding joints (examined
    during the Opti-stretch research). There is a noticeable difference in general flexibility of the body between
    “normal” and each of the groups of one through fourth degree hyperextensibility (during childhood and young
    adulthood).

<p>1˚ <b>Thumb:</b>
	    Gently try to touch the thumb to the forearm as seen in Figure 4. This figure demonstrates the normal range of
	    motion of the thumb. If you can touch the thumb to the forearm or even within the width of one finger from the
	    forearm, you are considered to have first degree or small joint hyperflexibility.</p>
<p>
    2˚
    <span>Elbow:</span>
    If you can hyperextend the arm, you are considered to have second degree or medium joint hyperflexibility. Note in
    Figure 5, how the forearm can be bent backwards.
</p>

<p>
    3˚
    <span>Knee:</span>
    If you can hyperextend the knee you are considered to have third degree or large joint hyperflexibility. This is
    simply bending the knee backwards.
</p>

<p>
    4˚
    <span>Back:</span>
    Significant hyperextension of the back. Usually only assessed in the individual who can perform the “Bridge” exercise. If the feet can be brought over the shoulders, this more extreme
    condition is commonly referred to as contortion. This is a rare condition. However, mild and moderate hyperextension
    of the back is quite common.

<p style="clear:both;">
    Anyone, with other than first-degree hyperextensibility, needs to be aware that some of the Opti-stretch exercises
    like (Figure Four) and (Butterfly) may be accomplished without difficulty. This makes these two very important
    learning stretches not very useful. However, in working with several hyperextensible individuals with either acute
    back pain or recurrent injury, an asymmetry was found in these two stretching exercises. They were unable to touch
    the nose to the knee on the side where they had back pain. Therefore, it is advisable to use the program as it
    currently exists, until a better one can be devised for the hyperextensible groups.
</p>

<p>
    A very common pattern of injury in this group is due to the combination of hyperflexibility and joint
    hyperextensibility. Joints appear to be less protected by stretch receptor reflexes. Joint and ligament trauma then
    causes indirect muscle spasm and associated back pain.
