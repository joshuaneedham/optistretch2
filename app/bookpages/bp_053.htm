	<h3>3. STANDING SQUAT â€“ PSOAS MAJOR AND MINOR MUSCLES</h3>
	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_065.png"/>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Stand in a slightly wide leg stance and squat down. Pretend you are lifting a small heavy box off the floor using
			an optimum lifting technique.</li>
		<li>If there is ankle tightness sometimes the feet need to be rotated to the outside. Still you should be in a stable
			position to lift something if you needed to.</li>
		<li>This is an extremely simple stretching exercise for children. In many foreign countries the majority of 60-80
	    year old individuals can get comfortably into this resting position and sit for hours. If you cannot comfortably
	    touch the hands to the floor, you by definition have to be <u>lifting with your back</u> instead of your legs.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is the <u>most dangerous</u> of the Opti-stretch Stretching Exercises.</li>
	    <li>While simple for many, those who are unable to comfortably achieve this position can experience the following:
		    functional compression of the aorta or vena cava causing transient high blood pressure or dizziness on standing up.
		    It is believed to be responsible for dislodging blood clots in individuals prone to blood clots.</li>
	    <li>Always have an <u>experienced spotter</u> to help you before attempting this position.</li>
		<li>Unfortunately, this is an extremely important stretching exercise. If you are healthy enough to work on it and
			finally achieve full range of motion you will be able to note a difference in how healthy your back muscles are.</li>
