    <p>a. &nbsp;Kneeling position with knees at least shoulder width apart or preferably as wide as possible.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Slowly attempt to place the pelvis area of the body to the floor. Arch or extend the back forward. The
        soles of the feet should be touching each other. If this is not a comfortable position, leave the feet spread
        apart. However, the feet must be the same distance apart and pointed in a precisely symmetrical fashion.</p>

    <p>Notes: This is a difficult stretching exercise to measure accurately.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The major stretch area is in the groin. If you feel the pull in one groin area more than the other does,
            this constitutes a risk factor.
        </li>
        <li>If the pull in the groin is symmetrical but one foot has to be moved to achieve this sensation, this also
            constitutes a risk factor.
        </li>
    </ol>
