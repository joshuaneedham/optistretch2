    This is simply a measurement of your height while standing on each foot separately. The height while standing on the
    right foot or the left foot may be the same or it may be several inches different.
</p>

<p>
    The easiest way is to practice standing on one foot while balancing on the toes of the other foot. (See figure
    below. This is as viewed from the wall.) With a little practice, a smooth transition can be made from the left foot
    to the right.
</p>

<p>
    A book works well to place on the head. The individual backs up until the bottom of the book is flush with the wall.
    This assures consistent distance from the wall and helps prevent rotation. A pencil is held by the individual or
    another person against a sheet of typing paper that has been taped to the wall.
</p>

<p>
    From an equal weighted stance, the weight is transferred to the right leg and then to the left leg. This can be
    performed several times until a consistent tracing is obtained. Measure the difference between the right leg height
    and the left leg height. The shorter leg distance is recorded for your records. (See below)
</p>
<p>
    Note that this distance may change several times during your life depending on the number of injuries and the extent
    of the injuries.
