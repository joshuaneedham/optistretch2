<h3>RECURRENT BACK STRAIN (MYOFASCIAL STRAIN)</h3>

<p>
    Both how <u>long</u> it takes to heal a back strain and the <u>pain severity</u> are important in grouping the types and presentations of “recurrent back strain”.
</p>

<p>
    In over 2000 individuals questioned, most all had experienced some type of minimal injury. Minimal or mild injury or
    less was reported 50% of the time. Moderate injury occurred in another 30%. Severe strain in only 20% of those
    having back pain.
</p>

<ol style="font-weight:bold;">
	<li>Minimal – Usually 1-2 hours maximum duration. Always less than one day duration.
    	<ol type="a"><li>Stiff and sore. (Experienced by completely healthy muscles as well.) [Note: Can be painful. Overactive
    		individuals in the “never any back pain” group will report this as an episode of “severe” back pain.]</li>
		<li>“Zinger” – sharp shooting pain that last seconds. Can occur in the back or a shooting pain radiating down the
    		front or side of the thigh. These always occur above the level of the knee. Pain extending below the knee can often
    		represent a serious sciatic nerve problem.</li></ol>
	</li>
	<li>Mild – Lasting 1-2 days and rapidly resolves.</li>
	<li>Moderate – Lasting 2-5 days and resolves over 1-2 weeks. After the first 2-3 reoccurrences many never seek
    medical attention. These individuals usually simply deal with the problem. The majority reported 1-5 years before
    the pain would reoccur. Commonly seen as a first presentation of back pain in teenagers.</li>
    <li>Severe – Lasting 1-2 months before feeling near normal. Often the patient will report that they
	“<u>never did return to normal</u>” after that injury. The pain is often so severe the individual cannot walk normally for 1-2 weeks. A comfortable
    position cannot be found either standing or lying down. Simple activities like getting dressed or putting on shoes
    can often take 15 minutes due to pain and immobility. The pain intensity is described as one of the most severe
    pains that the individual has ever experienced. It is often compared with the pain experienced with a broken bone or
    major surgery. The initial episode is frequently followed by a series of mild and moderate episodes. Generally not
    seen before age 20.
    	<ol type="a">
    		<li><u>Presentations of Severe Strain</u>
    			<ol>
    				<li>Severe immediate onset: Immediate onset of pain usually associated with a distinct activity (frequently heavy
    					lifting or heavy lifting while twisting). This is the most common presentation of the first episode of back pain.</li>
    				<li>Mild pain, then progressive: Immediate onset of only a mild pain, similar to a pulled muscle. Every 2 hours the
    					pain progresses in severity. Over a 6-8 hour period, the pain progresses to the level of severe pain.</li>
    				<li>Mild pain until twisting: Mild to moderate pain can exist for up to 1-2 days. However, with a slight twisting
    					motion, the pain instantly goes to a severe level.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</li>
    	</ol>

    Stretching exercises can be a very powerful tool. There is an old saying, “to a man with a hammer, everything looks
    like a nail”. Certain mild acute injuries can appear similar to a chronically injured muscle.
    <u>Acute injuries</u> <u><b>do not respond</b></u>
    to intense stretching techniques. Trying to stretch acute injuries can prolong healing and even make the injury
    worse. It is analogous to attempting to stretch a badly sprained ankle. The muscles must be allowed to heal to a
    certain level before stretching techniques are of value.
</p>

<p>
    A common scenario is that after a few weeks or months with the Opti-stretch technique people report “feeling
    better”. This sensation of “feeling better” often results in an increase of activity level. There is even a tendency
    for these individuals to increase activity levels very significantly. If they progress too rapidly without first
    conditioning the muscles, mild injuries are common. After overdoing the day before, they may awaken the next morning
    feeling fine. However, on reaching for something or moving differently, they notice muscle discomfort. A common
    response is to think, “there’s a muscle I haven’t used in a day or two”. Frequently it is a stiff and sore muscle
    that will improve with gentle stretching and slow progressive movement. It generally improves within 1 to 2 hours.
    However, this injury could be a mild acute injury that may be made worse with aggressive stretching techniques.
    Often these acute injuries are only discovered while doing the stretching exercises. Therefore, the injury is
    attributed to the stretching technique while in actuality the injury occurred the day before. For this reason, a
    gentle detection phase is performed to make certain there are no acutely injured muscles.
</p>

<p>
    There are some general guidelines for determining mild and moderate acute muscle strains. The most common way to
    gauge an acute injury is by the amount of pain or discomfort. While this type of scale is useful to the individual,
    not everyone’s scale is the same. For example, a strain causing severe pain to a six-year-old might be described as
    mild pain by a 16-year-old. To a 26-year-old professional football player, the exact same strain might be considered
    to be in the mild discomfort range.
</p>

<p>
    A helpful approach is to compare the acute or chronically injured muscle with a normal healthy muscle. There are
    several general types of “stretch-to-pain” transitions for muscle tissue. Healthy muscles have intensity of
    discomfort characterized by 4 recognizable points between “no sensation of any stretch” and the sensation of pain
    (see Graph 1, page 88). This allows 4 recognizable levels of discomfort. With any type of muscle tissue that is not
    healthy, the transition ranges are significantly shorted to the point that they are not recognizable by the
    individual. Different groups of muscles have slightly different transitions. For instance, the muscles of the neck
    respond very differently to stretch than do the larger core muscles of the hips and low back. While muscle groups
    vary, the muscles of a single group on either side of the body should not. If indeed the “stretch-to-pain” transitions
    do vary, this suggests that a muscle with a more rapid transition toward pain is not as healthy compared to the other paired muscle.
    By utilizing stretching exercises to tone the muscles, the muscles can again return to a healthy state. When the muscles
    regain their healthy state, pathologic conditions (i.e., shortened tendon) can be determined. If a tendon has indeed
    shortened, there is no good treatment for this condition except to maintain exceptionally healthy muscles in that particular
    muscle group.
</p>

<p>
    Muscles with tendon shortening appear to have more problems with healing properly than muscles without tendon
    shortening. The problem appears in part to be one of pure physics. A shortened tendon produces more stress on the
    muscle. This is seldom a significant clinical factor, if muscles are healthy. However, in a muscle that is unhealthy
    (poorly toned), this stress leads to increased fatigue of the muscle. This condition makes the muscle more
    susceptible to an injury than its paired muscle on the other side of the body.
</p>

<p>
    Prior to the 1980’s, there were no clinical diagnoses for the many chronic pain syndromes which physicians now
    recognize. Some physicians previously thought the condition to be “all in the person’s head”. The discovery of
    pathologic states causing disorders like chronic back pain, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and many
    others, led to the field of Chronic Pain Management, better known as “Pain Management”, (which I happened to
    specialize in). The working definition of chronic pain is pain that persists beyond two months without improvement.
    As a field of medicine, Pain Management is very new.
</p>

<p>
    “Recurrent back strain” is not considered a Chronic Pain Diagnosis. However in the most severe form, it becomes very
    similar to the diagnosis of Chronic Back Pain. Anyone who has severely pulled a low back muscle will often report
    that the injury bothered them for two to six months or even a year before they considered themselves back to normal.
    Even then, that identical back injury would again crop up several years later. This scenario is extremely common.
    These <u><b>irritated</b></u>
    muscles behave clinically similar to ACIMs, except that the individual can feel some type of discomfort or mild pain
    in the muscle. In the ACIMs the chronically injured muscle is present but “asymptomatic”. Whether this condition can
    transform into a true “chronic pain syndrome” is unknown. It is generally believed not to occur. However, for
    individuals over age 40, the severe form of a “recurrent back pain syndrome”, can cause near daily discomfort and
    significant limitations to physical activities. The condition can closely mimic certain chronic pain medical
    syndromes.
</p>

<p>
    Illustrated below are 3 general muscle types and their respective stretch-to-pain transitions. Keep in mind that
    both irritated muscles in various stages of healing, and poorly toned muscles, behave very similar to the ACIMs.
