        Opti-stretch is designed for only <strong><em>one</em></strong> of the 35 known causes of back pain. That one
        cause of back pain is “recurrent back strain”, which is due to muscle strain.
    </p>

    <p>It is, by far, the most common cause of back pain.</p>

        <u>Opti-stretch</u>
        is a very powerful program! If not done properly or if tried on other stretches, it can be potentially
        dangerous. In testing and perfecting this program I personally incurred hundreds of minor strains to various
        muscles. Also (mostly from my own stupidity and aggressive nature), I incurred two separate injuries to non-core
        muscles which took 6 month to completely heal. Even with a developed program, I incurred a 1-week injury to core
        muscles of the low back testing a newly published excellent scientific technique called PNF (proprioceptive
        neuromuscular facilitation). Please learn the basic concepts before you try to incorporate any new variation or
        any stretching exercise other than those specifically described in this book.
