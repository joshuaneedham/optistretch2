    <p>a. &nbsp;In the kneeling position, slowly lean backwards. Be sure to support the body weight with both arms. Feet
        should be at least pelvis width apart and pointed backwards or at a 45-degree angle. Make certain the feet are
        not pointed outwards at a 90-degree angle. This can put extreme stress on the inner aspect of the knees.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Support yourself with both arms until nearly the full range of motion has been obtained. When the
        buttocks can be placed on the floor, carefully lower the weight of the body to one elbow. If comfortable, lower
        the weight to the second elbow.</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ideally this exercise should be done with a spotter to help you back up should the stretch on the quadriceps
            become too great.
        </li>
        <li>Some individuals can then lower the back onto the floor. Due to the complexity, this position is not
            recommended. A spotter is definitely required to attain this position for safety reasons.
        </li>
        <li>There should be no significant stress on either the knees or ankles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A minor risk factor exists if the stretch on the front of one thigh is greater than on the front of the
            other thigh.
        </li>
    </ol>
