    Anatomy books state that the psoas complex functions as both a weak lumbar stabilizer and a weak hip flexor. It also
    contributes in bending to the side. In beef, the psoas muscle complex is referred to as the tenderloin. It is
    present in all forms of terrestrial mammals. Because there are no other vertebrates besides man that walks erect,
    the precise function is difficult to investigate. Investigation in humans is nearly impossible due to its location
    along the anterior (front) part of the spine and covered by the contents of the abdominal cavity. As it dives deep
    in the pelvis, conventional means for the study of muscle function are not feasible.

    Several papers trying to study the muscle have been written (Santaguida, P. L. and McGill, S. M. (1995) The psoas
    major muscle: A three-dimensional geometric study.
    J. Biomechanics). Each has concluded that this muscle is very difficult to study due to its location in the body.
    Also they report that the exact function is unknown.

    To make matters even worse, there is tremendous anatomical variation in the presence or absence of the muscles,
    composing the psoas muscle complex. Studies show the psoas minor is absent either unilaterally or bilaterally in 56%
    of humans. This number varies according to race (personal communication with Dr. T.R. Olson).
