    I personally enjoy reading about the history of different authors and how various new scientific theories have
    evolved.
</p>

<p>
    In 1997, at the age of 45, I was losing the battle with “recurrent back pain” in my own active lifestyle. My first
    <u>severe</u>
    back strain occurred at age 22 while working as a physical therapy aide. In attempting to catch a 250-pound patient
    from falling, I sustained a
    <u>severe</u>
    low back strain. X-ray evaluation was normal and the official medical diagnosis was “low back strain”. Despite
    aggressive physical therapy by my employers and periodic evaluation by an Orthopedic Surgeon, the injury took almost
    2 months to become pain free. I was told that it would eventually get completely better on its own. Despite
    returning to normal activity, my back <strong><em>never quite felt the same</em></strong>
    (until 23 years later). Multiple mild and moderate episodes of low back strain reoccurred over the next 9 years. The
    pain was always in the exact same location. It was always brought on by heavy lifting or twisting. The pain was
    easily recognizable on the right side of my low back just below the belt line over the sacroiliac joint. These
    recurrent strains usually healed in a few days or in just a couple of weeks. Compared to the first episode and far
    enough apart in months or years, they were never really considered too significant. After a couple weeks of exercise
    and working out, I would usually return to what I felt was full activity.
</p>

<p>
    At age 31, I was very active with skiing and tennis. A senior surgery resident informed me that I was limping. I had
    played 6 sets of tennis the evening before and felt fine. After weeks of insistence he made arrangements for me at
    one of the premier Orthopedic Surgery Sports Medicine Clinics in the Northwest. I was diagnosed with a short right
    leg. The right leg was measured as being a full 1-inch shorter than the left. I was given the option of wearing the
    highest insole lift made or having my shoes built up from the bottom for a full inch. As I was having no problem at
    the time, I obviously elected the former. A custom-made 1&frasl;2 inch insole lift was religiously worn in the right
    shoe for the next 14 years.
</p>

<p>
    A ski injury caused the second <u>severe</u> back strain. After four months of persistent discomfort and just not
    being able to get back to normal activity, I finally agreed to be seen by a friend’s Chiropractor. I felt that I had
    benefited somewhat by the manipulation. The discomfort had definitely changed in character and it gave me hope. The
    exercises that were prescribed were very beneficial.
</p>

<p>
    The fourth <u>severe</u> low back strain occurred at age 38. After overexerting while doing modified sit-ups on my
    morning work out, I felt some mild low back pain in the same old location. Hours later, I twisted slightly while
    reaching backwards at work. I felt the immediate onset of moderate to severe pain in my right low back area. Over
    the next 8 hours the pain progressed to severe pain. Due to the pain, I couldn’t stand up straight. A fellow
    resident finally helped me stand up straight. I could barely walk due to the pain. Even lying down trying to sleep,
    no comfortable position could be obtained. A back brace allowed me to walk, but it was 7 days before I was able to
    lift anything heavier than my shoes. It would take at least 5 to 10 minutes each morning to just put on my shoes.
    Although, I did not have any lost time at work, there were multiple setbacks during the total 2-month healing
    process.
</p>

<p>
    One notable problem occurred while just slightly bending forward at the waist. There was excruciating pain that
    caused my knees to buckle. It felt as though a knife had been stabbed in the right side of my low back. Severe pain
    existed in that bent knee position but trying to move either up or down was excruciating. I was simply unable to
    move. After being locked in that position for about 5 minutes, the pain gradually subsided somewhat and I was
    finally able to stand up straight again. (This is a fairly common problem with <u>severe</u> back strain.)
</p>

<p>
    After 6 months I tried to ski. Having been a ski instructor, I was considered an above average advanced skier.
    However, I didn’t progress much after starting to wear the insole lift. High performance ski boots just do not
    respond properly with a lift in only one boot. Even following a few gentle turns, if my low back did the slightest
    motion of a back bend, I would experience acute moderate back pain. The ski day was ruined. After 7 to 10 days the
    pain slowly resolved. During the next 4 years, I would do my routine exercises all year long to get ready for the
    ski season. Each year exactly the same thing would happen on the first run. Finally, after 4 annual attempts I
    simply gave up skiing for the next 3 years.
</p>

<p>
    By age 45, I had given up skiing and snowmobiling. I couldn’t comfortably pick up anything over 50 pounds even with
    an abdominal support binder on. I was rapidly becoming a real physical mess. I was in worse condition than some of
    the patients that I was treating for “chronic back pain”.
    <strong>
        <em>(Note that “chronic back pain” is a specific medical diagnosis and has completely different reasons and
            pathology compared to “recurrent back pain.”)</em>
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    The icing on the cake came when I could no longer lift my 3-year-old daughter over my head without back pain. She
    then weighed only 25 pounds. This was something she and I thoroughly enjoyed when she was little.
</p>

<p>
    The above scenario is that of <u>severe</u> “benign low back strain”. Only a very small percentage of the population
    suffers at this extreme level. However, it does account for millions of individuals in the USA alone.
</p>

<p>
    I was at that time an interim director at a large University Pain Management Clinic. I formally met on a weekly
    basis with some of the best neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists and occupation rehabilitation
    specialists in the nation. The large clinical team met to discuss the chronic pain patients, the majority of who
    suffered from low back pain. In that capacity, I attended meetings of the American Academy of Pain Management. This
    particular society was unique in allowing all types of alternative medicine specialists to formally present their
    theories and information. With my background in research and medicine, I finally had a great opportunity to formally
    evaluate other alternative medicine concepts and treatments for different types of back pain. I decided that if I
    had to succumb to significant incapacity due to back pain and not be able to share with my daughter simple sports
    activities, it would only be after <strong><em>leaving no stone unturned</em></strong>.
</p>

<p>
    At that time, I possessed a rather unique collection of knowledge including that which has already been mentioned
    before:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>17 years of practice as a MD.</li>
    <li>
        6 years of formal residency training including Anesthesiology and Pain Management.
    </li>
    <li>
        Master’s Degree in Zoology (physiology). [Note: A number of theories were generated from knowledge of animal
        science.]
    </li>
    <li>23 years of dealing with personal recurrent low back pain.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    First I reviewed the medical literature again and discovered some rather obscure studies on back pain. One
    interesting study from England dealt with a concept of a “Short Leg Syndrome” and the relationship to back pain. I
    carefully reviewed all the supporting references and the reason why this theory never gained much popularity.
</p>

<p>
    After one hundred years of unresolved controversy between tradition medicine and the Chiropractic community, I felt
    the Chiropractic field was the most likely to yield some insight into back pain. I had a fair amount of personal
    experience with various chiropractors. Even though I hadn’t received spectacular results from chiropractors, I felt
    there must be a reason why I hadn’t and other very reliable individuals had. Over two hundred hours were spent in
    the Chiropractic library, attending lectures and speaking with Chiropractic professors. Formal scientific studies
    were just then being jointly reported by both the Chiropractic community and the Traditional Medical community which
    showed no significant difference in the 1-2 month healing rate of
    <u>severe</u> back strain no matter whether Chiropractic, Physical Therapy or no therapy at all was performed.
</p>

<p>
    In short, I investigated most forms of spinal manipulation including Osteopathy, Naturopathy and Feldenkrais. Each
    were different but each had one common theme. Movement of the body (usually through manipulation) and the return of
    movement seemed to be the common denominator in all the above disciplines. From my Physical Therapy background this
    led me to other forms of active movement therapy programs such as Yoga, Alexander technique, Callenetics, the
    Egoscue method and Pilates method. Various other stretching techniques were studied, including Bob Anderson, Bill
    Pearl, Maxine Tobias, Judy Alter and Arnold Schwarzenegger to name a few.
</p>

<p>
    I evaluated over 350 stretching exercises and determined which were the safest and most effective for the specific
    muscles I had personally injured. Several techniques were developed to make stretching exercises more efficient (and
    fun). A concept of <u>stretch receptor lengthening</u> was evaluated. Martial arts and professional dance routines
    were evaluated. The most efficient technique to accomplish lengthening of the stretch receptors was developed.
</p>

<p>
    Then, I interviewed 2000 individuals to search for similarities to my injuries. I discovered that many, many, many
    individuals were just like myself. They really didn’t like to talk about back strain and having a “bad back”. There
    still appears to be somewhat of a social stigma from the 70’s where recurrent back pain was not felt to be real and
    was “all in one’s head”. To my dismay, this similar pathology in muscle tightness for certain muscle groups was not
    only common; it was <u>extremely common</u>. This condition was virtually non-existent in very young children. The
    incidence of this condition increased every 5 years of life to well over 60 to 80% of the individuals examined.
    While performing sports physical exams, I noted that the percentage of high school students with at least one
    asymptomatic chronically injured muscle (ACIM) detected in the upper back or neck was significantly higher than for
    middle school students. (Of note: due to the difficulty of examination, the low back examination was not performed.)
</p>

<p>
    Gradually the theories and concepts of Opti-stretch evolved. When I presented the early discoveries to colleagues
    and medical societies, there was some interest but many very good questions were raised. It took several additional
    years of further work and research to satisfactorily answer all the questions.
</p>

<p>
    After 5 years of research and testing, the evidence clearly suggests that in at least certain groups of individuals,
    Opti-stretch is a safe and effective form of identifying risk factors for recurrent back pain in generally
    <strong><em>healthy</em></strong> adolescents and adults. However, correcting these risk factors with the
    therapeutic techniques described in this book is not quite as safe. Unfortunately, there is a potential for injury
    in <u>everything</u> we do, even staying in bed all day. The Opti-stretch method, as a therapeutic program, can be
    potentially injurious. However, it has also safely returned hundreds of individuals to a newfound control in their
    lives of not being dependent on various doctors and medications when back pain would frequently
    <strong><em>reoccur</em></strong>. It also significantly improved their activity levels. Remember this is
    <strong><em>not</em></strong> a program for any back pain that is brand new to you or any acute back strain (which
    can often appear very similar to certain types of Chronically Injured Muscles). Nevertheless, I personally believe
    that Opti-stretch can and does offer a relatively safe, scientific program for improving back health which literally
    millions of individuals can potentially benefit from. It is the first new scientific discovery pertaining to
    recurrent back pain in the last 100 years.
