<p>
    In Step #2 you will learn the stretching technique that Opti-stretch has found to be most helpful in returning tight
    and tender muscles (ACIMs) to normally toned muscles.
</p>

<p>
    There are a couple of important topics that need to be covered. Stretching properly is complex. First, the
    terminology often has different meanings to different people. The body has several different types of stretch
    receptors that serve different functions. Stretching is simply applying an increasing force to a joint or joints to
    put stress on the muscle to increase the range of motion. If the same force is applied rapidly to a tendon the
    muscle will reflexively contract (like a doctor hitting your knee with a reflex hammer). This is a protective
    reflex. Muscles themselves possess several different types of stretch receptors. The most familiar ones are the
    stretch receptors that warn when the muscle is being “stretched”, to a specific range of motion. If this gradually
    increasing force continues to be applied, the sensation of stretch changes to a sensation of discomfort. The levels
    of discomfort can be referred to as mild, moderate, and severe. If the stretching force continues to gradually
    increase, the severe discomfort sensation progresses to a pain sensation. At the pain threshold level, the muscle
    will usually experience some type of microscopic injury.
</p>

<p>
    Muscles have two opposite functions. One is to contract and
    <u>move</u>
    a joint through a range of motion. The other function is to spasm and
    <u>immobilize</u>
    a joint. This spasm is an important part of the healing process. The muscle gradually relaxes the spasm over days to
    weeks, depending on the extent of injury. The muscle can spasm in response to various types of pain stimulus from
    surrounding structures. This can be due to muscle tissue injury, injury to the surrounding connective tissue
    (myofascia), or injury of a tendon, bone or joint. Any of these injuries will result in spasm and an acute injured
    muscle. During the first few days of a severe injury, there are injury stretch receptors that protect the muscle and
    joint structures. Early injury stretch receptors can detect very little of any type of stretch sensation. Instead,
    even slight movement will transition directly to the pain state. As the muscle heals, a warning level of discomfort
    will develop before the level of pain is reached. As the muscle more fully heals, the level of a stretch sensation
    then reoccurs.
</p>

<p>
    Stretching exercises can be used as a tool in several specific functions. The Opti-stretch Therapeutic Technique
    utilizes the first three of these four functions. The specific functions of stretching exercises are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Detection of both acute and chronic injuries. (Risk factors can then be detected in the chronic injury state,
        which most commonly involve asymptomatic chronic muscle injuries (ACIMs) or tendon shortening.)
    </li>
    <li>Warming up the muscles (mild intensity only).</li>
    <li>Therapeutically stretching the muscles so over time the range of motion of the muscle will be improved. (The
        goal is to optimally stretch the muscle and restore proper tone, so that the stretch receptor is lengthened
        allowing further range of motion for a given intensity of force delivered to the muscle.)
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1. &nbsp; Documentation that you have achieved at least two inches of increased stretch
        (stretch receptor lengthening.)
    </li>
    <li>Cooling Down Muscles after a hard workout to prevent stiffness and soreness.</li>
</ol>
<h3>A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUE FOR<br>STRETCH RECEPTOR LENGTHENING<br>
    <span style="font-size:80%">(used for Beginning and Intermediate Programs).</span></h3>

<p><b>Therapeutically stretching the muscles requires certain <u>special techniques</u>:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Breathing Technique (Incremental exhaling during stretch and inhaling during relaxation of the stretch. Forced
        exhalation used in The Therapeutic Phase).
    </li>
    <li>Incremental Movement Technique (Uses 3 progressive incremental stretches of approximately 1&frasl;4 inch with
        only partial relaxation after each incremental stretch).
    </li>
    <li><u>Intensity</u> of Force Technique as determined by different levels of discomfort. A properly toned muscle
        will have 4 sensations of stretch discomfort before the level of pain is reached (see Table 1, page 83 and Graph
        1, page 88).
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1. &nbsp; Determination of the “<u>first</u> sensation of stretch” (whenever any sensation
        of stretch occurs in any area of the body). Distance stretched from the “first sensation of stretch” to the next
        noticeable change in discomfort “<u>second</u> sensation of stretch” is the <u><b>mild discomfort</b></u>
        stretch range.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2. &nbsp; Distance stretched from the “second sensation of stretch” to the “<u>third</u>
        sensation of stretch” is the <u><b>moderate discomfort</b></u> stretch range.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3. &nbsp; Distance stretched from the “third sensation of stretch” to the “<u>fourth</u>
        sensation of stretch” is the <u><b>moderately-severe discomfort</b></u> stretch range.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.4. &nbsp; Distance stretched from the “fourth sensation of stretch” to the “<u>first</u>
        sensation of pain” is the
        <u><b>severe discomfort</b></u> stretch range. This stretch range is for learning purposes only! Just 3 specific
        stretching exercises are suitable for this intensity level.
        The “<u>fifth</u> sensation of stretch” starts the “<u><b>mild pain</b></u>” range. This intensity of stretch
        level should never be reached, otherwise injury will likely occur.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>THE INCREMENTAL BREATHING TECHNIQUE</h3>

<p>The following two techniques for breathing and movement are necessary in order to have optimum success. Unless these
    two concepts are fully understood, chances are high that either an injury will occur or the benefits you are seeking
    will take a long time in coming.</p>

<p>The breathing technique may sound simple but is very important. There appears to be normal reflex mechanisms in the
    body that allow muscles to relax while exhaling. There are also mechanical factors that allow the core muscles of
    the lower and upper back to stretch slightly further after forced exhalation.</p>

<p>First pronounce the letter “O”. Keep the mouth in the same position. Next, practice exhaling so a slight blowing
    sound of air can be heard both by you and another person, if they were standing beside you. Approximately one third
    of the lung volume should be expelled each time you think to yourself the numbers: one, two, three. The cadence is
    one number every 1 to 1 1&frasl;2
    seconds. This will exhale most of the air from the lungs. Next, think of the word “and”. While saying “and” you
    inhale for 2 to 3 seconds. The rate should be relaxing, slow and rhythmical. It does take a little practice to judge
    the amount of air to both exhale and inhale so that you neither get short of breath nor hyperventilate.</p>

<h3>INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT TECHNIQUE</h3>

<p>The cadence is “1-2-3-and”. Start by finding the point of the “first sensation of stretch”. Very slowly and gently
    stretch 1&frasl;4 inch or less for each of the three numbers. Approximately
    1&frasl;2 the distance across the nail bed is the maximum amount of a slow gentle stretching movement that you will
    want to make while thinking each number. This means 3&frasl;4 inch is accomplished in 3 smooth and gentle movements.
    During the “and” segment, the stretch is relaxed by one half inch while breathing in. Therefore, for each cadence,
    the total distance progressed into the stretch is only 1&frasl;4 inch.</p>

<h3>OPTI-STRETCH STRETCHING SEQUENCE</h3>

<p>Properly stretching a muscle to achieve stretch receptor lengthening is best achieved using an “Opti-stretch
    Stretching Sequence”. This is composed of a <u>detection phase</u>, a <u>warm-up phase</u>
    and a <u>therapeutic phase</u>. Each is performed somewhat differently. Located in Graph 3, page 177, is a
    diagrammatic presentation of the following description.</p>

<p>The <u>detection phase</u> (Check and Stretch) is used to determine if there are any minor acute injuries to the
    muscles. In the comfortable ready position, the stretching exercise is slowly performed only to the level of the
    “first sensation of stretch” (Check). This is the first part of the <u>detection phase</u>. Opti-stretch research
    has demonstrated that this point is reached at a very similar location of stretch for many groups of individuals and
    for different conditions of the muscle tissue. The distance into the stretch is easily memorized. If you detect this
    distance to have shortened or is noticeably more uncomfortable than previously, the likelihood of an acute injury is
    high (stop stretching for at least two days to allow time for the muscle to start healing). Gently detect the “first
    sensation of stretch” three times and then return to the ready position. Repeat the process a second time. This
    should take only 6 to 12 seconds.</p>

<p>The second part of the <u>detection phase</u> is the “stretch”. Go to the “first sensation of stretch”. This is by
    definition the start of mild discomfort stretch. The stretch is slowly and cautiously continued to where there is
    any noticeable change in this mild sensation of stretch. This point is a “second sensation of stretch”. This is
    depicted diagrammatically in <u><b>Graph 1</b></u> – <u>Muscle Stretch to Pain Transition</u>, page 88. Unless there
    is an acute injury, this transition point is the start of moderate discomfort stretch. For certain sized muscles and
    also poorly toned muscle this stretch distance could be less than 2 inches. In a optimally toned muscle it could be
    6 or 8 inches. There are 4 of these easily recognizable transition points before the onset of mild pain in any large
    muscle that is healthy. It is around this second transition point (transition from mild to moderate discomfort) that
    you will perform the warm up phase and the therapeutic phase. After months in the program, other transition points
    can safely be worked at.</p>

<p>The <u>warm-up phase</u>
    is used to properly warm up the muscles so that you are able to proceed with the therapeutic phase. A slight
    modification of the classic incremental movement technique is used. At an intensity force level causing mild
    discomfort, the incremental movements are held for 1 second with gentle exhalation (<u><b>Table 1</b></u> – <u>Therapeutic
        Intensity Levels for Stretching</u>, page 83). During “and” the intensity of force is partially released and a
    breath is inhaled. The cadence is (5-4-3-2-1-“and”). This process allows for slight increases in range of motion
    while using the exact same intensity level of mild discomfort. This cadence is repeated two more times.</p>

<p>The <u>Opti-stretch Therapeutic Phase</u> uses Opti-stretch incremental breathing technique, incremental movement
    technique and a maximum forced exhalation. Using the <u>incremental breathing</u> and <u>incremental movement</u>
    technique, explained on the previous page, the cadence is (1-2-3-“and”). This is referred to as a <u>subset</u>.
    Initially, 3 Optistretch subsets are performed and then followed by a forced exhalation. This is referred to as the
    Opti-stretch Therapeutic phase.</p>

<p>A <u>set</u> consists of a Detection Phase, a Warm Up Phase and two Opti-stretch Therapeutic Phases. A total of 3
    sets (separated by 1-minute rests) are performed for each exercise during the daily exercise routine. [(Graph 3) in
    the Appendix, page 177]</p>

<p>Following 2 months of daily Opti-stretch, a third Opti-stretch Therapeutic Phase can be added to the set and is then
    referred to as an <u>intermediate set</u>.</p>

<p>During the incremental exhalation, slow cautious range of motion increases are performed. A predetermined intensity
    level is chosen before an Opti-stretch Therapeutic Phase is attempted. Over weeks and months of continued daily
    exercise, the muscles gradually become more toned and range of motion is optimized for the given body type.</p>

<p>Of special note, the <u>forced exhalation</u> is performed after the third Opti-stretch subset. The chest is
    contracted to slowly but forcefully exhale the last residual lung volume. The forceful exhalation often allows 1
    full inch of increased range of motion without any further increase in the intensity of discomfort level. <b>Do not
        exceed 1 inch</b>, even if you think you safely can. Serious strain injuries have occurred by exceeding this
    1-inch limit (especially when the muscles have become more toned). This is the end of the Opti-stretch therapeutic
    phase (3 subsets and a forced exhalation). The stretch is then released to the intensity level of discomfort where
    you started into that Opti-stretch phase. The therapeutic phase is repeated a second time in order to complete one
    set. [(Graph 3) in Appendix, page 177]</p>

<p><u><b>Warning.</b></u> Complex anatomical, physiological and even psychological forces are combined during the forced
    exhalation part of the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Phase. While very effective and helpful in daily increases in range
    of motion, once the muscles have become toned, several individuals have reported comfortable 3 to 6 inch gains in
    range of motion during the forced exhalation. This excess distance can be <u><b>very dangerous</b></u>. A sudden
    tearing of the muscle covering called the myofascia can occur without any warning. This can cause a severe muscle
    strain. These individuals reported no sensation of discomfort; they simply heard a “pop”. Shortly thereafter, the
    muscle became extremely painful and had been seriously strained. Remember not to exceed the recommended 1 inch of
    extra stretch during forced exhalation. For this and several other reasons, <u><b>do not</b> use Opti-stretch
        techniques on any other stretching exercises except those demonstrated in this book!</u></p>

<p>Follow the sequence of the stretches shown in the book. The most important exercises are shown first. This allows the
    most important exercises to be completed if there happens to be a time constraint that particular day. Furthermore,
    during the one minute rests between exercise sets, muscles on the opposite side of the body can then be stretched.
    For those exercises that stretch both sides of the body at the same time, go to the next exercise, which usually
    starts in a similar position (i.e., kneeling). After a week or two of learning the technique, start with the tighter
    side first. A total of 3 sets are performed on the tighter side, and 2 sets on the more flexible side. This will
    help correct the asymmetry more smoothly. If more than an inch of stretch receptor lengthening occurs on the more
    flexible side without an increase in the tighter side, you may have to cut even more sets from the more flexible
    side. <b>Do not</b> promote the asymmetry by more than 2 additional inches from your initial screening test without
    adjusting your program. (see Table 4, page 175).</p>

<p>Following 2 months of working in the “second sensation of stretch” (transition between mild and moderate discomfort)
    the second Opti-stretch set can be performed further into the moderate discomfort level. No more than two sets
    should be performed at any predetermined higher intensity level. The muscles become fatigued and the chance of
    injury is higher. This is one instance where “more is not better”.</p>

<p>For the first 2 to 8 weeks of practicing Opti-stretch stretching exercises, do not go any further than the intensity
    level of a mild discomfort and the beginning of moderate discomfort. If you seem comfortable with these levels and
    start to see results, stay at that level. However, if you want to try a more aggressive, efficacious, and slightly
    more risky level from an injury standpoint, the <u>Optimum Opti-stretch intensity level</u> is presented. Even for
    “extreme” individuals and those who push the envelope on any physical activity they engage in, the following is the
    <u>most intense level</u> that should be tried.</p>

<p>The safest way to start learning about this maximum Opti-stretch intensity level is by practicing stretching the
    fingers. Here you can learn with tendon and joint stretch receptors that are more sensitive than core muscle stretch
    receptors. Extend all 4 fingers of the left hand backward with the right hand. This is performed both slowly and
    gently until you feel a mild stretch. Release the stretch and move both hands to see if there is a sensation of
    continued stretching on any finger. Wait at least one minute. If there is no sensation of a continuing sensation of
    stretch after the stretch has been released (residual stretch), repeat the process to what you think a moderate
    discomfort stretch level might be.</p>

<p>If no level of residual stretch has been obtained, repeat the above sequence on the same 4 fingers increasing the
    stretch slightly by only 1&frasl;16<sup>th</sup> of an inch past your level of moderate discomfort. Continue noting
    the difference in the sensation between the mild, moderate, and the new moderately-severe discomfort level.
    Eventually, there will be a point where a sensation of residual stretch occurs for less than 15 to 60 seconds. This
    is, by definition, the <u>severe discomfort</u> level. The level of stretch just prior to this and following your
    moderate discomfort level is by definition the moderately-severe discomfort range. This sensation of
    moderately-severe discomfort should be memorized. It is the most effective intensity range that you can safely work
    in and still avoid overstretching injuries. You <u>never</u> want to enter the intensity level of mild “pain” (which
    is a residual sensation of stretch that lasts from 1 to 5 minutes). Any residual sensation of stretch lasting more
    than 5 minutes is likely due to a strain injury. Over the next 2 to 8 hours, this can result in very painful spasm
    of the muscle. (See Table 1, page 83).</p>

<p>Practice this technique only on the (Figure Four), the (Butterfly) or “Supine Straight Knee to Nose” stretching
    exercises. <u>Less</u> than this level of intensity must be used on all of the other stretching exercises. <b><u>Remember</u>!!
        You have stretched too far if:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li><b><u>Any sensation of residual stretch is felt</u>. If the residual discomfort lasts for more than five
        minutes, consider this to be an acute injury and wait two days before resuming the stretching exercises.</b>
    </li>
    <li><b><u>Any stiffness or soreness occurs the following day</u>.</b></li>
    <li><b>In repeating a stretch, the level of moderate discomfort is reached <u>noticeably sooner</u> than from a
        prior stretch.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Most people see a definite improvement in the stretching distance (stretch receptor lengthening) in 2 to 3 months. If
    no improvement is noted, you may need to consult with a qualified instructor to determine if there might be
    something in your technique that could be improved. It may take up to 6 months to achieve your own specific goals,
    depending on your preexisting muscle tone and your age.</p>

<p><b><u>The following is a very important point to remember!</u></b></p>

<p>The above Opti-stretch technique is based solely on sensation of the muscles and not by achieving the same distance
    of stretch as you did the day before. The muscles and their stretch receptors are a very dynamic system. If there is
    a little bit of extra lactic acid build up from the prior days’ activities, if you are a little run down, stressed,
    or if a cold is coming on, you may not be able to reach the same level of stretch as you did the day before. If you
    then try to obtain the same range or a little further than the day before, you will eventually injure a muscle.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this is to perform the Opti-stretch Technique with the eyes closed or partially closed. If you
    are focusing on reaching a certain distance of stretching you are <u>not</u> fully concentrating on what the muscles
    are telling you. Therefore, you will eventually strain a muscle with stretching exercises. This is even more
    important the older you are. Use the <u>measured distances</u> only as a guide to weekly or monthly progress.</p>

<h3>VARIATIONS IN STEP # 2</h3>

<p>
    Step #2 or the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Technique may be accomplished in different ways. Some people find that just
    trying to get into the basic starting position for certain exercises in the Intermediate Therapeutic Program is
    difficult. For this reason a <u>Beginning Program</u> has been constructed. After achieving good range of motion on
    these stretching exercises, return to the Intermediate stretches.
</p>

<p>
    For time constraints, the Low Back exercises (Screening Exercises 1-12) in the Intermediate Screening Program should
    be mastered first during the first couple of weeks. Then start incorporating the Upper Back and Neck exercises
    (especially if this is where the areas of recurrent pain are located). The goal is to both obtain equal movement on
    each side of the body and obtain as close to the “gold standard” as possible.
</p>

<p>
    If you have only neck pain, carefully test for asymmetry of the lower and upper back. If there is asymmetry, the
    neck muscles are difficult to fully rehabilitate if the lower and upper back asymmetry is not corrected first. If
    there is a time constraint, you are better off to first correct the lower back, then the upper back and then the neck.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a 20-minute daily time constraint, you may have to then tailor your Therapeutic Program to your own
    particular needs. Always work first on the low back. My particular routine is as follows: Intermediate Screening
    Exercises 1-14, and then starting to gradually add in Advanced Exercises 3 and 8. Advanced Exercises 4 and 7 are
    then periodically worked on. On the weekends or 2 to 3 days a week spend some time on the Upper Back and Neck
    exercises. After 2 to 4 months of the Low Back stretching exercises, you will find the goals on Upper Back and Neck
    exercises will be achieved both faster and easier.
</p>

    A synopsis of the daily exercise routine is provided in the Appendix, on the Beginning and Intermediate Worksheets.
