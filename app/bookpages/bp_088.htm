<h3>18. CHIROPRACTIC AND OTHER MANIPULATIONS</h3>
<p>
    Manipulation is simply defined as any operation “done by hand”. In carefully observing the majority of manipulation
    techniques, such as Osteopathy and Physical Therapy, what essentially is being done is that the therapist is
    stretching your muscles for you. This is often referred to as direct manipulation.
</p>

<p>
    Indirect manipulation is generally practiced by chiropractors. Often one joint or muscle is stretched in order to
    provide relief to another injured muscle or nerve.
</p>

<p>
    Spinal manipulation dates back to the time of Hippocrates. Various manuscripts from early Egyptian, Greek, Chinese
    and Hindu reveal that certain types of chiropractic treatment have been around since the early beginnings of man.
    Bone manipulation was practiced in the Middle Ages. A type of chiropractic technique was noted in the Native
    American Indians, when they had the children walk barefoot on a painful back to help relieve the pain.
</p>

<p>
    “The Father of Chiropractic” is recognized as Dr. D. D. Palmer, who in 1895 performed the first documented
    chiropractic manipulation in the USA. Described in the literature as a “frontier renaissance man”, he was a
    schoolteacher, farmer and Iowa grocer who first started practicing under the title of a “Magnetic Healer”. In the
    early years of Chiropractic, the “lumbar roll” was developed. The precise physiologic process behind the technique
    has eluded investigators both in and out of the Chiropractic profession.
</p>

<p>
    This single technique called the “lumbar roll” has evolved as a mainstay for the profession. In the 1980’s, there
    was a significant fervor for trying to solve the mystery of the lumbar roll’s “million dollar pop”. A million
    dollars was offered to anyone who could explain the “pop” and why it was effective. Since the 1980’s, the
    physiological theory behind “the pop” has generally become accepted as a process of “cavitation”. This means that
    pressure on the joint can displace small amounts of dissolved nitrogen gas causing a “pop”. The gas is then
    reabsorbed over the following hour. This appears to be a normal physiological function of the joints to displace
    acute stress forces.
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of things that are known about the “lumbar roll”:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Early high velocity techniques suggest that the manipulation does not directly involve the severely spasmed and
    injured psoas muscles of common severe low back strain. However, by relaxing major hip flexor muscles (accessory
    muscles of the psoas complex), the “lumbar roll” indirectly helps to reduce the spasm and pain in the psoas muscles.</li>
	<li>It first evolved as a high velocity, high-energy manipulation of the lumbar spine. Today, low velocity and
		moderate velocity manipulation are used with equal efficacy.</li>
	<li>Chiropractors formally teach that the manipulation is the essential ingredient and not the “pop”. Therefore, an
    equally efficient manipulation is obtained with and without the “pop”. Manipulation of a healthy spine demonstrates
    that a “pop” is often difficult to generate.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    I have watched many skilled Chiropractic physicians perform the “lumbar roll”. I also spent approximately 200 hours
    in one of the finest libraries of anatomy that I have ever seen, which was incidentally at a College of
    Chiropractic. I also enrolled as a “guinea pig” at the College of Chiropractic to have student’s practice on me.
    Having also studied aspects of manipulation from various other medical sciences, I have proposed a plausible theory.
</p>

<p>Opti-stretch theory suggests that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The “pop” appears indeed to be consistent with a theory like cavitation. A simple demonstration of cavitation is
    the following. If one fully flexes the fingers toward the wrist (without any assistance), the distance can easily be
    noted with a pen mark. Then, if an average individual “pops” their knuckles, the fingers will be able to flex 2
    millimeters further. Over the next hour, the fingers will
    not “pop” again. After at least a one-hour rest, the fingers can no longer flex to the longer distance. However,
    upon “popping” the fingers again, the two millimeters further range of motion is restored.<br>
    <br>This suggests that the cushion of dissolved nitrogen gases provides a safety valve so that when a stress occurs, the
    release of this safety valve allows for increased range of motion and less trauma to the joint and its
    musculo-skeletal structures. This provides further joint movement, allowing the spasmed muscles of the spine to
    partially relax and therefore helps relieve pain (usually at least an hour). Even partial relaxation of the muscle
    may help to break the “pain – spasm cycle” of back pain and provide the patient with some pain relief.<br><br></li>
	<li>The muscle groups primarily stretched during the “lumbar roll” are the major hip flexor muscles of which there
    are at least six. The fact that there are many muscles serving the same function makes it less likely to injure any
    one specific muscle. As described previously, when a muscle is strained or sprained, it tends to go into spasm. If
    the injury is severe enough, accessory muscles will help out by going into spasm to further immobilize the joint. If
    the injury is extremely severe, the antagonistic muscles will then also spasm to provide maximum immobilization of
    the bone or joint.<br>
    <br>The antagonist muscles in the Opti-stretch theory are the erector spinae muscles of the spine. In severe back
    strain, they are tender to the touch and have marked knots and spasm. I learned that as a physical therapy aide,
    over a week or two, through diathermy and massage, the erector spinae muscles could easily be relaxed. These erector
    spinae muscles would clinically appear to be back to normal healthy muscle tissue to the touch (knots, tenderness,
    and tightness were gone). However, only the severe back pain would be improved. The mild and moderate back pain
    would still require additional weeks of therapy to heal the back completely.<br>
	<br>The back pain would be expected to persist because the psoas complex muscles were severely injured and have not yet
    completely healed (which usually takes one to two months no matter what therapy is employed). The accessory muscles
    of the psoas complex are the major hip flexor muscles. These muscles are in
    <u>reflex spasm</u>
    but not individually injured. By taking the major hip flexor muscles through the given range of motion of the
    “lumbar roll” the spasm of these muscles is partially broken. Partial spasm relief and subsequent pain relief of
    accessory muscles will trigger some relaxation of the antagonist muscles of the lumbar spine. If this is done every
    day or every other day, the severe pain is reported by many individuals to disappear faster than without therapy.<br>
    <br></li>
	<li>This explains why individuals are prompted (by the return of pain and by their Chiropractic physician) to return
		on a frequent basis following acute injury.<br><br></li>
	<li>This may help to explain why 19.5 million people in the United States annually go to chiropractors. They feel
    they get faster relief of their severe pain symptoms. Anything that helps take away the
    <u>severe pain</u>
    of back spasm, even for 24 hours is a welcome relief. Once all the <u>severe</u>
    pain is gone, the average person doesn’t focus quite so much on the length of time it takes to completely heal the
    injury.<br><br></li>
	<li>This also explains why traditional medicine has analyzed the results over and over in very sophisticated studies
		and has found there is no faster healing of a severely injured back when Chiropractic is employed.</li>
