<p><b>Congratulations</b>, this is the final step of the Opti-stretch Challenge. The Therapeutic Program used stretch receptor lengthening for new range.
The Maintenance Program simply preserves this new found optimum range of motion, even into advanced age.</p>

<p>
    Some may have slightly overshot their optimum range of motion in order to properly tone ACIMs. Therefore, the
    Maintenance Program range of motion could be somewhat slightly less, as-long-as movement on both sides are
    symmetrical. This way, the Maintenance Program becomes time-efficient and designed for decades of continual use.
</p>

<p>
    Some enjoy performing these exercises on a daily basis. Many find it relaxing and invigorating at the start or end
    of their day. Others, like myself, prefer not having to perform daily stretches. By understanding the physiology
    presented in this book, good warm up techniques prior to high activity levels can also be used to preserve muscle
    tone and avoid injury. If the later is chosen, a weekly level of complex movement activity needs to designed.
    Different activities for the different seasons of the year work well.
</p>

<p>
    For example, after completing the Intermediate Program, the activity I chose was swimming. It requires complex range
    of motion while at the same time strengthens and conditions the body. During rests, the “Kneeling Back Bridge”,
    “Squat”, and “Finger Touch” can be easily performed in the water to make sure that all the major muscle groups are
    exercised. The more complex motion the activity has, the less need for daily stretching.
</p>

<p>
    I started the Maintenance Program, when I was able to obtain equal range of motion on both sides. If unable to
    achieve this range of motion in 3 sets, I usually restart daily stretching for a week or two. Then, I try every
    other day stretching. After a couple weeks, every third day is tried. For the first year, twice a week or weekly
    tests should be performed to make sure you can still comfortably reach your optimum range of motion.
</p>

<p>
    No matter what type of maintenance program you choose, the most important goal is to maintain your optimum range of
    motion. The best way to achieve this, is to have fun. Muscle physiology is very dynamic. This makes it enjoyable to
    perform periodic tests, to evaluate how the muscles are doing. Also, if this level of range of motion is not
    maintained, my back seems a little stiff; activities start becoming more uncomfortable and fatiguing. One of the
    last things I want, is returning to the vicious cycle of a “bad back”.
