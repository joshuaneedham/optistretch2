	<h3>7. SUPINE FEET APART â€“ ADDUCTOR MUSCLES</h3>
	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_071.png"/>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>In the supine position use the arms to spread the feet apart. The distance apart of the feet can be measured.</li>
		<li>Extra stretch can be applied by using the arms to pull the shoulders and upper body slightly forward.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Note:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>While this is the safest way and best way to perform the stretch in the beginning, once the adductors have been
			sufficiently toned, other more effective ways of stretching the adductors can be experimented with.</li>
		<li>My personal preference is the standing stretch. The legs are horizontal and wide apart. The right adductor is
	    stretched by keeping the right leg and hip straight while the left knee is slowly bent. The hands are on the floor
	    for support.</li>
	</ol>
