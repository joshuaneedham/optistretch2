    <h2>SUMMARY OF THE<br>OPTI-STRETCH PROGRAM</h2>

    <div class="hrwrap">■ ■ ■</div>
</div>
<p>
    A major accomplishment of the Opti-stretch Program was to demonstrate that certain individuals, over time, can
    regain a certain range of motion. This improved range of motion and subsequent conditioning of back muscles leads to
    a significant decrease in muscular back strain, and increase in both activity levels and athletic ability. The
    application of this knowledge can be of extreme benefit to the benign back pain sufferer (especially those suffering
    from moderate and severe pain syndromes).
</p>

<p>
    Some people believe that the Opti-stretch goals of optimum range of motion to the level of the “gold standard” with
    certain stretching exercises are possibly too extreme. These specific goals are provided as stopping point goals. If
    a person suffers from poor posture or a recurrent back problem, he or she may have to obtain such levels before they
    can honestly say that no stone has been left unturned. Stretching beyond these levels has not demonstrated any
    significant improvement in back health.
</p>

<p>
    Even with exercising the limited asymmetric side twice as much as the more flexible side, many do not reach symmetry
    and complete toning of the muscles until close to these optimal ranges-of-motion. Assuming that you had to work and
    develop at least 2 or more inches of stretch receptor lengthening to reach this optimal level, there is probably
    little to be gained by pushing the range of motion further. Hence, these ranges are optimal for most people. This
    provides both a stopping place to reside at
    <u>and</u>
    a realistic level to maintain for life.
</p>

<p>
    Remember two things. First, there are individuals in their 60’s and 70’s that can do these stretches without any
    difficulty at all. Next, there is greater than a 90% chance that as a healthy child, you were doing all of these
    stretches on a regular basis while playing. This means your body at one time had been conditioned to do these
    stretches. It is far easier to regain a previous level of stretch than to push to new extremes. If you couldn’t do
    these stretches as a child, you will be unlikely to reach this level as an adult. This knowledge gives you some
    realistic goals to strive for. Obviously with certain severe injuries and medical conditions, these goals may not be
    realistic. Other more reasonable goals then must be substituted.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch combines incremental breathing techniques, incremental movement techniques and certain therapeutic
    intensity force levels in order to provide optimal toning of the essential core muscles required to lift heavy
    objects. You are more than welcome to add additional stretching exercises to your own daily routine after completing
    the two to six month program. Remember, do not use the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Technique on any stretching exercise
    that is not included in this book. Another exciting part of the program is that it provides an excellent basis for
    evaluating the health of the back and the back muscles for an entire lifetime.
</p>

<p>
    Individuals, who are hyperflexible and find these stretches too simple, need to pay particular attention to body
    symmetry differences. In addition, more specific stretches may need to be devised for this group of individuals to
    adequately assess basic health of the back. This is discussed later in the Scientific Consideration section #9:
    Hyperflexibility and Double-jointedness.
</p>

<p>
    Once the basic Opti-stretch routine has achieved
    <span>either</span>
    symmetry
    <span>or</span>
    optimum range of motion, it is necessary to strengthen these muscles by at least 10-15%. There are many good
    published programs and sports trainers that can provide this knowledge. The final step of regaining optimum muscle
    health is to choose a good conditioning program. The easiest way involves some type of enjoyable sport.
</p>

<p>
    There are certain sports that require performing an even more excessive range of motion than the optimum levels
    recommended by Opti-stretch. While this type of excessive range of motion has been implicated in causing certain
    problems, it has never been scientifically proven to be detrimental. However, while these excessive ranges-ofmotion
    are advantageous in a given sport, they have never proven to be markedly beneficial in maintaining healthy muscles
    or joints. If you want to pursue excessive range of motion, first strive to obtain a good healthy set of core
    muscles at the Opti-stretch “gold standard” level. Some individuals make the mistake of pressing on to extremes of a
    given range of motion before first assuring a healthy set of core muscles. This can lead to developing significant
    body asymmetry.
</p>

<p>
    Body asymmetry is extremely common in young girls. The parents will say, “look how flexible she is; she can even do
    the splits”. On closer assessment, the girl will be able to comfortably do the splits with say the right leg
    forward. However, she may be able to go only half way down in completing the splits with the opposite leg forward.
    This is a classic example of body asymmetry and a risk factor for injuring the core muscles of the back. Remember
    that people with extreme range of motion often have as many
    <u>or even more</u>
    back problems than someone with very poor or limited range of motion.
    <u>Absolute range-of-motion</u>
    is not the key.
    <u><b>The key is an optimal range of motion for your given body type.</b></u>
    Opti-stretch is designed to help you both recognize this goal and achieve it. Eventually, the forces of nature such
    as aging, injury or disease will limit this ability. Hopefully, this will be long past the age of 85. Even then, you
    will still be at your optimum and that is generally the best you can realistically hope for.
