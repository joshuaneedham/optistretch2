	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Be cautious not to strain the knees with this stretching exercise.</li>
		<li>This particular stretching exercise can put tremendous strain on the low back. Be very careful.</li>
		<li>If there is a rapid transition from mild stretch to significant discomfort in the low back, there is a good
    possibility you may have tight iliopsoas and psoas complex muscles.</li>
		<li>If this stretching exercise reproduces your low back discomfort you need to seriously consider the full 6 months of Opti-stretch Intermediate Therapeutic Program and obtaining the maximum levels of range of motion.
			<u><b>This stretch is used for diagnosis and not for daily use due to the excess stress on the knees.</b></u></li>
