    The month of October is set aside as “Family Health Month”. “Stay Active!” “Stay fit!” The epidemic of back pain is
    a major cause of decreased activity levels in all parts of the world today. Many unfortunate sufferers of recurrent
    back pain find that after the second or third reoccurrence, they either consciously or subconsciously scale back on
    their level of activity. For many, this is quite effective. Many who scale back to only the activities of daily
    living find a significant decrease in recurrent back pain unless this level of activity is exceeded.
</p>

<p>
    While a decreased level of activity is acceptable for some, the majority of individuals have a strong desire for a
    more active lifestyle. These individuals are sensible in trying to maximize the protection of their back. Often,
    they can even gradually work up to some very impressive activity levels. However, once every one to five years the
    right combination of stresses occurs to cause a recurrent back strain.
</p>

<p>
    Until Opti-stretch, only a relatively small percentage of individuals with recurrent back strain syndrome have found
    the right combination of exercises to regain a completely
    healthy back. The major reason is that the core muscles of the back are extremely difficult to strengthen and
    condition unless there is at least a certain level of toning of the muscles. Trying to strengthen tight and
    chronically injured muscles without first toning the muscles, frequently leads to reinjury.
</p>

<p>
    Presented in this book are the major types and locations of recurrent back pain that are due solely to muscle
    strain. Realize that if your history of back pain is not similar to the described examples, you may have something
    other than benign back pain. More importantly, just because you have what appear to be ACIMs does not rule out other
    more serious underlying pathology. Anyone who has had even a single episode of moderate or severe back strain should
    consult a medical doctor.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch specifically identifies tight and chronically injured muscles due to muscle strain. The stretching
    exercises are scientifically designed to tone the core muscles of the back, which are most commonly responsible for
    recurrent low back pain. The “gold standard” and major goal of Opti-stretch, is to return your muscles to the same
    tone you enjoyed as a “3 to 5 year old”.
</p>

<p>
    Why is the average range of motion of a “3 to 5 year old” set as the “gold standard”? After all, many professional
    athletes and individuals with very healthy backs cannot reach the “gold standard”. Remember that range of motion is
    largely hereditary and related to body type. However, once a recurrent strain syndrome has occurred, it may be
    necessary reach the “gold standard” to completely re-tone the chronically injured muscles. Currently, there is no
    evidence suggesting that
    <u>further</u>
    range of motion beyond the level of a normal “3 to 5 year old” is significantly beneficial for a healthy back in
    most normal individuals. (Recall, this may not prove to be the case in the hyperflexible group.)
</p>

<p>
    It is well known that if there is no range of motion of the muscles or joints, there is no “activity” level. Even
    small increases in range of motion toward normal can have profound increases in activity level. Next, we know that
    there are large groups of individuals with excessive range of motion. This group often suffers from high incidence
    of recurrent back and hip pain. Somewhere between these two extremes there appears to be an optimum range of motion
    or “gold standard”. Flexibility steadily decreases from birth. Between ages “3 to 5”, 95% of healthy children can
    easily perform all of the exercises in the Advanced Stretching Program. By age 5, flexibility takes one of three
    different pathways. Either flexibility continues to decrease (common in most males), flexibility can stay the same,
    or flexibility can increase (common in many females).
</p>

<p>
    Of the 2000 individuals interviewed, approximately 400 (most over the age of 40) were in the “never had any back
    pain” category. Many had some mild asymmetry but the majority were quite symmetrical. Their range of motion either
    equaled or was within 3 or 4 inches of the “gold standard” for every exercise in the Advanced Program (with the
    exception of the “Bridge”). However, those individuals with recurrent low back
    strain syndromes could not complete the Advanced Program stretching exercises and frequently demonstrated
    significant asymmetry of between 1 to 8 inches.
</p>

<p>
    The next breakthrough in Opti-stretch came with taking a previously very inflexible athletic male and restoring him
    through six months of Opti-stretch to the “gold standard” level. Fortunately, the back pain decreased in proportion.
    Remember, if a 45year-old who experienced tight muscles since adolescence can reach the “gold standard”;
    <u><b>you probably can too</b></u>! This is an extremely exciting discovery of the Optistretch program.
</p>

<p>
    If you were a normal “3 to 5 year old”, you were at the “gold standard” level. Therefore, with the proper amount of
    work and over sufficient time, Opti-stretch has shown that the “gold standard” is indeed a realizable goal. Even if
    you are unable to reach this level, every inch of stretch receptor lengthening accomplished allows the core muscles
    of the back to become more toned, more symmetrical and therefore more healthy.
</p>

<p>
    Chronically painful joints and other types of chronically painful tissue send signals to the muscles to change into
    their protective or spasm mode. While gentle Opti-stretch may be helpful, this is one condition that has proven to
    be extremely problematic.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch is an exciting new stretching exercise program for ages 6 to 86. If you perform the Screening Program
    and can find no risk factors, and if you consider yourself to be a healthy athletic type of individual, give the
    Advanced Program for Fit Athletes and Children a try. If you can perform these stretching exercises, you are either
    in or very close to the 20% of the population who are at little or no significant risk for recurrent back strain.
</p>

<p>
    Now that you have read the book, you owe it to yourself to at least give the
    <u>Screening Program</u>
    a try. Located in Appendix C is a sample of results from my Intermediate Screening Test and measurements after my
    Intermediate Therapeutic Program. Completion of the screening tests is the first step of the
    <u><b>Opti-stretch Challenge</b></u>. On a comfortable exercise mat or thick carpet, sit down and record
    <u><b>your own results</b></u>. Remember that you only stretch to your own comfort level. The intensity of stretch
    must be the same for both sides and it has to be held for at least 5 seconds (30 seconds is even better). All the
    stretches do not have to be completed at one session. When you finish, if you do not have any risk factors in the
    Beginning or Intermediate Tests consider the
    <u>Advance Program for Fit Athletes and Children</u>. If you can pass this program chances are extremely high that
    you have well toned core muscles in your back and you have passed the final step of the Opti-stretch Challenge. Keep
    the results, these measurements can prove extremely useful in the rehabilitation of an unfortunate severe injury
    like a fall or auto accident. Also, the stretching exercises can be repeated between every six months to every five
    years to assure nothing has changed and that the core muscles of the back are aging gracefully. Also, these
    stretching exercises should be performed after healing any significant injury to either the extremities or the
	back. This will detect whether there might have been some incomplete healing in the core muscles of the spine, which
    can easily go unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
    If you do happen to detect any risk factors, consider eliminating them with a two to six month
    <u>Opti-stretch Intermediate Therapeutic Program</u>, which is the second step in the Opti-stretch Challenge. (If
    any of the stretches seemed difficult just getting into the starting position go directly to the
    <u>Beginning Program</u>
    for at least two months.) Then, give the
    <u>Advanced Program</u>
    a try. The third and final step of the
    <u><b>Opti-stretch Challenge</b></u>,
    is the Maintenance Program. You will then know that you have successfully turned over one more stone in your battle
    against recurrent back pain.

    Good luck with Opti-stretch! I sincerely hope it will be as beneficial to you as it has been to others.
