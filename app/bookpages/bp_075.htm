<h3>TABLE 2 – ACUTE MUSCLE INJURY</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Minimal injury</b>.
    This consists of stiff and sore muscles that can generally be worked out in at least two hours by no more than 80%
    MAX (moderate discomfort). If they cannot, then you have, by definition, a mild injury.</li>
	<li><b>Mild injury</b>. This injury is associated with mild pain on movement of the muscle. It will usually return to essentially normal in
    two to three days. If I think I have a mild injury, I stop stretching for two days, apply ice for 20 minutes at
    least once a day, and try to avoid as much activity to that area as possible, so as to rest and heal the muscle.</li>
	<li><b>Moderate injury</b>.
    This injury is associated with moderate pain and usually remains painful at rest. I don’t even bother to try
    stretching these muscles. Ice therapy with the application of ice for 20 minute every one to two hours for at least
    the first couple of days is recommended. In five to seven days the pain at rest noticeably subsides. Gentle
    stretching can then be attempted. Start at 50% MAX intensity. This injury usually heals back to normal in about one
    to two weeks.</li>
    <li><b>Severe injury</b>. These injuries always produce some sensation of injury immediately at the time of
    occurrence. However, on occasion the severe pain may not start for two to eight hours. It often will gradually build
    up in intensity. Severe pain is defined by an inability to walk comfortably or find a comfortable place to rest,
    even while lying down. Simple activities like putting on your shoes may take 20 minutes. In speaking with hundreds
    of individuals who have suffered severe muscle strain, they rank it among their most intensely painful experiences
    in life both due to intensity of pain and length of healing. The pain ranks right up there with broken bones, heart
    attacks, and major operations. A physician should always evaluate this type of severe pain. William’s Flexion
    Exercises are the gold standard for acute care of a severely strained back. These usually can be started safely
    after a few days or the first week. However, Opti-stretch techniques should not be attempted until you can rest
    comfortably in bed and can walk fairly normally. This is generally at least two to four weeks. Always restart with
    the Beginning Exercises. Never exceed 50% MAX for the first two months or until your physician officially states it
    is all right. You need to be cleared for regular activity.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Opti-stretch puts significant stress on the lumbar core muscles and hence, on the lumbar discs. Instead of a severe
    muscle strain, it is possible that you could have just as easily sustained a partially herniated disc. Although it
    has not yet happened, in theory, it could be possible to convert a small herniated disc into a major herniated disc
    requiring back surgery. Don’t attempt anything above 50% MAX exercises for at least two months or until your
    Orthopedic Surgeon has released you to normal activity. If you don’t know where your 50% MAX level is for sure,
    <b><u>don’t do Opti-stretch</u></b>
    until released by a physician for normal activity or at least six months of healing has occurred.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch, so far, has proven much like other forms of therapy for acute injury. It may make you feel a little
    better sooner, by taking out some of the spasm, but it simply does not heal an acute injury faster. Once the injury
    has healed sufficiently,
    <u>then</u>
    Optistretch may be extremely useful in regaining 100% health to the muscle. But remember; do not employ this therapy
    until the muscle is properly healed.
</p>

<p>
	<b><u>Don’t try to push any acute injury!</u></b>
	Don’t even push stiff and sore muscles! The Optistretch technique is very powerful and therefore, very  dangerous  in  acute  muscle injuries and injuries that involve the fascia or bones. You will also be happy to know that any progress you have made in your range of motion usually does not significantly change for about one to three weeks. The bottom line is that if you don’t know where things are with healing or if you are not steadily improving, simply
	<b><u>avoid all Opti-stretch activities</u></b>
	for at least two months after a severe injury, or until you have received a formal medical consultation. This is especially important
	<b><u>whenever</u></b> you suspect any acute injury that is not progressing along the time frames given above.
