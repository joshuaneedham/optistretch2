        This book is designed for general information only and not for medical advice. Opti-stretch contains new
        scientific theories that as of this printing have not been reproduced or substantiated in large populations of
        individuals.

    <p>
        New types of stretching exercise routines are explained that you may not have used before. Several of the
        stretching exercise routines require significant strain to joints and muscles as well as significant exertion.
        As with all new exercise routines and exertion levels, a medical or health professional must be contacted prior
        to starting any program.
