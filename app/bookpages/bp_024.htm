    <p>a. &nbsp;Sit with the left knee extended. The right knee is bent with the arch of the foot touching the inside of
        the knee. Note the position so it can be duplicated on the right side.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Slowly attempt to touch the nose to the knee. When the nose is two inches above the knee, this is the
        start of the excellent position. The majority of 6-year-olds can obtain this position.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;Maximum stretch is the chin to the knee and holding the left foot. This is an example of an anatomically
        delimited stretch for a given stretch or position. If the stretch is performed in the standing position even
        greater stretch could be delivered to the hamstring muscles by extending the head past the knee. This is also
        much more dangerous of a stretch.</p>

    <p>d. &nbsp;Measure the precise distance with a flexible tape measure or piece of string on each side.</p>

    <p>Note: If unable to even sit comfortably in the (a) position, then it is important to start with the “Supine
        Straight Knee to Nose” stretching exercise [Exercise: 3(a) and 3(b)] until the sitting position becomes
        comfortable.</p>

    <p>Risk factors for Back Pain</p>
    <ol>
        <li>More than one inch in measured difference between the left and right side.</li>
        <li>Inability to get into the “Sitting Nose to Knee” position comfortably.</li>
    </ol>
