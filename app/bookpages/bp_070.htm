<h3>7. INVOLUNTARY STRETCHING  – (INSTINCTIVE  STRETCHING)</h3>

<p>
    Nature teaches us a great deal about stretch receptors and their importance. The word “stretching” originally
    referred to a very characteristic involuntary stretch reflex that every mammal demonstrates (with the exception of marine mammals). Presumably, marine mammals do not need to stretch
    because they never stop moving for prolonged periods from the time they are first born. They even swim in their
    sleep. Terrestrial mammals all have some type of prolonged inactivity (usually during sleep) and demonstrate an
    instinctive stretching routine upon awakening or getting up from a prolonged rest. In higher vertebrates, the most
    universal stretch is a bending of the lumbar spine backward (referred to as a backbend). Most everyone has seen a
    dog or other animal stretch. This is a genetically controlled involuntary reflex movement and referred to as an
    instinctive stretch in animals.

<p>
    In some forms of vertebrates, such as ducks, very characteristic stretching
    <u>routines</u>
    are used for their wings even among different species. This also is genetically programmed and appears to be more of
    a stretching routine rather than a reflex type of movement observed in higher vertebrates.
</p>

<p>
    Study of involuntary (instinctive) stretching in mammals may seem rather insignificant, but many important
    discoveries in medicine have been made while attempting to explain why certain phenomena exist in multiple species
    (the process of teleology). An expression used frequently in medicine and science is that “common things are
    common”.
</p>

<p>
    A classic involuntary stretch, in man, is the
    <u>yawn</u>. Certain muscles are relaxed while others are forcefully contracted to produce a very characteristic
    movement. Most of us know what it is like to yawn. It is something that can be
    <u>imitated</u>
    but not fully reproduced, through conscious effort. Furthermore, approaching the same range of motion of the jaw
    through conscious effort is quite uncomfortable. During an involuntary stretch, the involuntary portions of the
    brain can specifically relax certain muscles while contracting others. Most likely, there are many other complex
    physiologic processes responsible for a comfortable yawn.
</p>

    Every healthy terrestrial mammal including man involuntarily stretches at birth. The onset is generally considered
    to be the “quickening” of the fetus. In most mammals this process continues until old age. The response then slowly
    decreases and finally stops altogether. Two things that will
    <u><b>stop</b></u>
    the instinctive stretching process in mammals for short periods are
    <u>disease</u>
    and
    <u>injury</u>. In the case of significant injury, the limb is held immobile by the animal. As the limb starts
    healing, the mammal will start progressively moving and testing the movement of the limb. This progresses to gradual
    weight bearing and eventual complete return of movement to the limb. Once the limb has returned to near normal
    function, the instinctive stretching resumes. Dogs with an amputated front leg will resume instinctive stretching
    once the surgical incision has healed sufficiently.
</p>

<p>
    The exact purpose of this involuntary stretch in terrestrial mammals is not well understood. One plausible theory is
    that it tones muscles and helps protect them from injury.
</p>

<p>
    Following prolonged inactivity or sleep, involuntary stretch re-tones the muscles, making them less susceptible to
    injury. However, when a mammal is frightened from sleep, a phenomenon referred to as the “fight or flight response”
    occurs. In this case adrenaline immediately re-tones the muscles and powerfully maximizes immediate muscular
    performance, while at the same time decreasing the chance of muscular injury.
</p>

<p>
    One explanation, as to why the instinctive stretching usually stops at old age, is that this type of stretching may
    be extremely important for maintaining the muscular health of individual members of a species. In nature “survival
    of the fittest” is an essential principle. Many known
    <u>genetically programmed physiological phenomena</u>
    exist that help animals to survive in the reproductive years. However, beyond this point and into old age, there are
    other types of programmed physiological phenomena that actually help the animal pass through old age as quickly as
    possible. The cessation of stretching is seen in old age, as well as, during significant disease and injury.
    Therefore, in theory, continuing to do stretching, as one ages, might actually help slow the aging process and
    preserve muscular vitality for years longer. For those that have lost muscular vitality and tone through lack of
    activity or chronic injury, regaining this muscular health can be like discovering a “fountain of youth”.
</p>

<p>
    Humans are quite unique as a species in that only a minority of individuals continue to demonstrate instinctive or
    involuntary stretching past the time of puberty. The number of individuals who do not perform involuntary stretches
    appear to be more common in Western societies and other “modern” societies. This may well be due to the stresses and
    hectic lifestyles commonly seen in these societies. It may be as simple as a lack of activity with specific range of
    motion, which can lead to detoning of the muscles and subsequent cessation of the involuntary stretch. However,
    extensive research has not yet been done in this area.
</p>

<p>
    Healthy individuals (many who work on farms) report this type of involuntary stretching even at ages 60 to 70.
    Opti-stretch has demonstrated that once the muscles are optimally toned, the involuntary stretching can return, even
    following decades of cessation.
</p>

<p>
    Stretching exercises, first popularized in Western cultures during the 1940’s, are purported to tone muscles and
    help slow the natural aging process. Using an extension of the argument expressed above, the most important muscles
    to be stretched would be those muscles involved with involuntary stretching. The most important muscles stretched
    with an involuntary stretch are the core muscles of the body. Furthermore, like the yawn, gaining the same level of
    range of motion as generated by the subconscious mind in an involuntary stretch is very difficult by implementing
    general stretching exercise techniques commonly in practice today. The most popular technique of stretching is to
    stretch to a level of mild or moderate discomfort and hold for 30 seconds. If one opens the mouth to simulate a yawn
    only to the level of mild discomfort and holds for 30 seconds, the range of motion is significantly less than the
    range of motion generated with a normal involuntary yawn. You will note that attempting to
    imitate the range of motion of the yawn will result in moderately-severe discomfort. From experience, we know that
    if one pushes the discomfort level to severe discomfort or to the level of actual pain, acute strain injury of the
    muscle can occur. All these and many more factors have been investigated by Opti-stretch in order to have an
    effective but injury safe program.
</p>

<p>
    A stretching exercise does not just stretch a single muscle. However, for any given stretch one certain muscle or
    group of muscles receives the maximum amount of stress generated during that stretch. By consistently coupling the
    fixed position of other joints, certain muscles can be more specifically isolated. This is why there can be multiple
    stretching positions designed to stretch even a single muscle. As previously suggested above, instinctive stretches
    may have more physiological significance than previously recognized. In watching many children and infants stretch,
    there appear to be many similarities just as there are many similarities when individuals yawn.
</p>

<p>
    The most commonly observed pattern of involuntary stretching in humans involves pulling the shoulder blades closer
    together and bending the spine backwards at the level of the low back (or backbend). In this position, the psoas
    muscle receives the most stress of all the low back muscles. The psoas muscle is one of the most complex muscles of
    the body. It will be explained in more detail later (see
    <u>Section 14</u>. The Psoas Muscle). Furthermore, it is important to note that the different patterns and type of
    movement generated by involuntary stretching are not common movements in most routine daily activities in humans,
    especially in Western culture.
</p>

<p>
    During the above involuntary stretch, the upper back and arm stretches are equally interesting. Individuals, who
    still experience involuntary stretching, describe a significant sensation of muscle well-being in-between the
    shoulder blades. Only a small stretch is perceived in the front part of the shoulders. However, between the shoulder
    blades, the rhomboid muscles are actually contracting and not stretching. This is because the rhomboids are one of
    the few muscles that are very difficult to stretch due to the function of the shoulder and shoulder blade (scapula).
    If one tries to perform a stretching exercise for the shoulder blades, the rhomboids are protected from stretch by
    other more sensitive shoulder muscles. One of the best ways to tone and condition the rhomboid muscles is to
    maximally contract the muscles rather than stretching them. Mother Nature may have guessed that the average human
    was not going to stumble on to this concept too easily, so she programmed it into an involuntary stretch for humans.
    From a teleological standpoint, the precise reasons for involuntary stretching are quite intriguing.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, the classic involuntary stretch seen in all healthy infants involves arm, upper back and lower back
    movement. Stretching of the arms and upper back seems to be centered on the area between the shoulder blades
    (specifically the greater and lesser rhomboid muscles). The simultaneous stretch of the low back appears to center
    around the psoas muscle complex.
