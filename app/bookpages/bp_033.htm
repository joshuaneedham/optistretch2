    <p>a. &nbsp;Start in the prone position.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;From the prone position, slowly elevate the upper body leaving the pelvis on the floor. This should put
        a stretch on the low back.</p>

    <p>Notes: This position is extremely gravity dependent on the low back and should be done very carefully.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The stretch is felt primarily in the low back, but also in the groin areas. If a stretch can be felt more in
            one groin than the other, this is considered a risk factor.
        </li>
        <li>If it can be felt on one side of the lower back more than the other, this also is a risk factor.</li>
    </ol>
