<h3>3. BONES SPICULES AND MUSCLE HEALING</h3>

<p>
    A significant strain to a muscle causes injury to the individual muscle fibers. When there is clinical evidence of
    the injury like swelling or bruising, a
    <u>strain</u>
    is then referred to clinically, as a
    <u>sprain</u>. Because of the depth of the core muscles of the back, seldom does this type of clinical evidence
    manifest itself. Therefore, back strain, rather than back sprain, is usually diagnosed in most lifting injuries
    involving the back.

<p>
    On a cellular level, when muscle tissue is damaged and pulled away from the bone, a healing process occurs much like
    healing a broken bone. Small needle-like fragments of bone tissue (spicules) are formed between the muscle fibers in
    the first few weeks following injury. Weeks later, the bone fragments are dissolved as scar tissue heals the injury.
    With strengthening of the muscle fibers, the muscle returns to essentially normal with the exception of various
    amounts of scar tissue formation. Unless the strain is extremely severe, seldom do peripheral muscles of the limbs
    have a tendency to become restrained. Usually, the healing process is 110%, which means there is very little chance
    of recurrent strain in that area of the muscle. In sharp contrast, certain core muscles commonly form asymptomatic
    chronically injured muscles (ACIMs), which have a very high rate of recurrent strain.

<p>
    With a true
    <u>sprain</u>
    (anatomic damage), the individual experiences immediate severe pain in the muscle so that any movement causes
    further pain. In 5 to 7 days, the muscle will start to feel better and begins to allow movement. The range of motion
    of the muscle is usually still very limited. As the injury heals, movement gradually returns. There is also a change
    from immediate pain when the muscle is moved. As the muscle heals, some type of warning level of discomfort will
    occur. This warns that if there is any further stretch, pain will occur. Anyone who has sustained a severe muscle
    strain knows the last
    1&frasl;2
    inch of range of motion is always the hardest to heal and often takes months to completely heal. In this last
    1&frasl;2
    inch of range of motion, the muscle frequently undergoes several minor
    <u>reinjuries</u>
    or strains before total healing occurs. Frequently a month or two later, the exact same muscle injury can “act up”
    again. Some injuries can take six months to over a year before the muscles seem back to normal again.
</p>

<p>
    Commonly, the muscle heals to where it functionally feels pretty good but the last
    1&frasl;2
    inch of range of motion has not yet returned. In limb muscles, this is usually quite obvious to the individual and
    in today’s modern medicine, this limitation is generally unacceptable. Physical Therapy is usually prescribed and
    over time, the range of motion of the muscle and joint is usually returned to normal. In the core muscles (muscles
    of the spine, hips, neck, and shoulders) this last
    1&frasl;2
    -inch of decreased range of motion frequently goes undetected. Unfortunately, the individual usually does not know
    the precise range of motion of these core muscles, prior to the injury. Therapists have broad ranges, which are
    considered normal. Therefore, when the pain stops and the muscle fells better, many still have not reached their own
    personal and preexisting range of motion.
</p>

<p>
    Clinically, using most of today’s standard methods, this difference in range of motion of core muscles can be very
    difficult to detect and evaluate. Also, the optimum range of motion varies quite significantly for each individual
    body type. Much of this individual variation appears to be genetically controlled. Also, there can be large
    variations due to environmental control. Therefore, certain core muscles can feel essentially normal but simply have
    not completely healed to the level of a healthy muscle and go completely unnoticed. This problem can last for
    decades, as you will see below.
