<h3>11. ACUTE MUSCLE INJURY</h3>

<p>
    How do you know the difference between an acute muscle injury, reinjury pattern or a chronic muscle injury? This
    unfortunately is a difficult concept to teach but it can be learned by experience.
</p>

<p>
    Acute injury means there has been some type of acute tissue damage. The skin, bones, ligaments and muscles all heal
    at about the same rate for a severe injury. Often minor injuries are much more subtle and difficult to detect. For
    example, you may feel fine on a given day. However, by chance you may touch a spot on your skin that is tender. If
    there is no bruise, most likely you will remember bumping the area a day or two prior. However, if it not only feels
    tender and you can see a bruise, you will recall the
    event that caused this injury. Often the black-and-blue skin changes may take a few days to form and confirm your
    suspicions.
</p>

<p>
    A skin bruise is simply skin that received sufficient stress and damage, which was sufficient to break tiny blood
    vessels. All healthy tissues are the same. A muscle bruise and a bone bruise have roughly the same amount of blood
    that has leaked from tiny blood vessels for a given mild injury. However, frequently you can’t see or medically
    confirm this problem other than touching the area for tenderness. A bruise and a strain will heal exactly the same
    way (over time).
</p>

<p>
    Most everyone has strained an ankle or other joint. There is almost always a sensation of something “not being
    right”. If it is very mild, you may still continue running on the ankle. However, by the end of the day, the ankle
    may be swollen and painful. Then, you are certain you have at least sprained the ankle. Remember the only medical
    difference between a strain and a sprain is that you or your doctor can identify traumatic changes like swelling or
    skin bruising with a sprain. If you only strain the ankle, no differences may be clinically seen. However, the ankle
    still hurts when you try to move or bear weight on it. There are many joints, like the ankle, that can appear only
    to have sustained a strain. However, on x-ray evaluation a small piece of bone may have been broken off. Even if it
    is only a small bone chip, this is still considered to be a severely sprained ankle and usually requires several
    weeks of healing. If a cast or walking splint is not applied, the usual way to heal the ankle is to apply an ace
    wrap and limp around for a few days. Eventually, as the swelling and pain decrease, the limp decreases also.
    Gradually, more activity then can be applied to the ankle. During this later stage of healing of an acute ankle
    strain or sprain, stretching exercises can be of value.
</p>

<p>
    However, it you sustained a badly sprained ankle and started stretching exercises that same day and each day
    following, chances are you would actually slow the healing process. This is because there would be a prolongation of
    the inflammatory phase of healing. You would be subjecting yourself to needless discomfort. As mentioned earlier,
    there are some tissues that will never heal properly if you continue to irritate them and fail to let nature heal
    the tissue to at least a certain level.
</p>

<p>
    A small skin cut that forms a scab is the classic example. If the scab is removed every day so there is even a
    little bit of bleeding, that skin lesion will never heal in the lifetime of the individual. The broken bone, if
    moved daily, will often abnormally heal in 2 pieces instead of one. During severe injuries like a broken bone, the
    body, in order to protect and promote healing, causes severe spasm to all agonistic, accessory and antagonistic
    muscles of that area. This effectively immobilizes the bone fragments to promote healing. Also, intense pain results
    with any type of motion, effectively preventing motion until the bone or injury has sufficiently healed. In modern
    medicine, a cast is usually applied to both immobilize and decrease the reflex muscle spasm.
</p>

<p>
    Severely strained muscles and ligaments sometimes heal better with a cast. However, the majority of the time mild
    and moderate strains usually heal better without a cast. Medical doctors will usually provide a splint, sling,
    crutch, or guidelines for use, to provide enough protection to where the injury will start to heal. As it feels
    better, you are instructed to gently increase mobility and use, until the area returns to normal. However, if the
    injury does not return to normal or if the injury remains too painful for too long, you are instructed to return for
    further evaluation. Too painful and too long are both something you have to judge by experience, while the medical
    doctor learns these parameters through training.
</p>

<p>
    Many individuals, who are experiencing a severe strain injury for the first time in the extremities, will return to
    a doctor after a couple of weeks thinking a bone is broken. An X-ray with bone spicule formation within the strained
    muscle will definitively demonstrate that the strain was indeed severe. The patient is reassured that another four
    to six weeks may be necessary for complete healing. However, they are usually instructed to return if it has not
    healed by at least two months. Very few severe injuries take longer than two months to significantly improve. More
    importantly, if there has been a complication in the healing process and if the individual waits much longer than
    two months, the complication may have healed to a point where it is not easily treated. Most people learn about
    these things either through four years of medical school, personal experience as an overactive kid, or “Dr. Mom.”
</p>

<p>
    Injuries to the muscles of the back are no exception. If you try stretching the muscles before they have had a
    chance to heal to at least a certain point, you are probably wasting your time and possibly prolonging the
    inflammation phase of the injury.
</p>

<p>
    One notable exception is the stiff and sore muscle. When overuse of a muscle leads to stiffness and soreness the
    next day, gentle stretching exercises can be very helpful in clearing the lactic acid build up more rapidly. When
    the muscle is acutely stiff and sore, it is significantly more susceptible to injury. However, if the lactic acid is
    cleared by an hour or two of movement, usually a near maximum performance of the muscle can be expected without any
    significant risk of injury.
</p>

<p>
    So how do you differentiate between a minimally injured (stiff and sore) muscle and a mildly injured muscle? This is
    not an easy question to answer. Often stiff and sore muscles are actually more painful and incapacitating than a
    mild or moderately injured muscle. As a general rule of thumb, stiff and sore muscles usually involve multiple
    muscles. A strain involves usually only one muscle, except when it is a moderate strain and involves the agonistic
    and accessory muscles. In a severe strain, three different muscle groups are often involved (agonistic, accessory,
    and antagonistic). This concept is discussed more fully under the topic Chiropractic and Other Manipulations in
    Section 18.
</p>

<p>
    Detecting, acute strains and properly dealing with them, is something that can be learned with time and experience.
    When you originally learn the Opti-stretch technique,
    it is by comparing healthy muscles to asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMs). The individual then
    may feel great for months. Then one day he or she overdoes it or performs an activity they are not used to.
    <u>Mild</u>
    acute muscle injuries often feel very similar to an asymptomatic chronically injured muscle. Therefore, they attempt
    to continue using Opti-stretch techniques and either don’t get the same relief or actually make the mild
    acutely-strained condition worse. This is an extremely common mistake. Because individuals are taught in the
    Opti-stretch technique to be aware of distances for the purpose of positive feedback and effective measurement of
    progress, many often mistakenly try to stretch to a given distance rather than a given sensation.
</p>

<p>
	The concept of “Oh, I’ll just try a little harder to reach that distance” is very dangerous and is completely against what Opti-stretch  tries to teach.    The concept that needs  to be adhered to is referred to as the “just right” or “the Goldielocks” phenomenon.
	<u><b>More is not better</b></u>.
	Too cold or too little, may not be enough. However, too hot or too much may be injurious. “Just right” is a concept that varies among people and must be learned individually.
</p>

<p>
    Remember that a stiff and sore muscle will be effectively worked out in one to two hours by using gentle warm-up
    exercises. If the soreness persists longer, it usually indicates a mild injury. The mild injury will tend to get
    worse or not be improved after the two hour maximum. Sometimes after an extremely strenuous day of say digging
    ditches, it takes one to two hours to effectively work out the stiffness and soreness on awakening. A second hard
    day’s work can then be safely performed. However, if I am able to work out only part of the stiffness and soreness
    using 80% MAX (moderate discomfort), I may return the following day to digging ditches but I will try to be a lot
    more careful and cautious for a day or two, in order to avoid a muscle strain. The same thing applies to play.
</p>

<p>
    If I’m up on a beautiful mountain for a day of skiing and find I’m a little stiff and sore from the ride up or from
    the day before, I don’t turn around and go home. I just perform the stretches to a level that I comfortably can.
    This level is no more than 80% MAX [moderate discomfort] for any minimal or mild injury. If I cannot reach my normal
    level of stretch, I don’t just try harder or exceed the moderate discomfort level. If, I’m a few inches off my
    normal level, I simply use a little more caution and avoid extreme skiing for at least the morning. After lunch, I
    reassess the muscles to determine how aggressive I can be for the rest of the day.
</p>

<p>
    However, if I determine that there is an acute
    <u>moderate</u>
    injury to a muscle, I will spend the day in the lodge rather than risk the chance of a severe injury. These concepts
    are very basic. While this knowledge is usually learned by trial and error by individuals, Opti-stretch can be of
    significant value in providing a more objective assessment of the possibility that an acute injury has occurred.
</p>

<p>
    To make things more complex, you may not even realize you have a mild or moderate injury until you move the muscle.
    You may not even know you have injured a muscle until you are doing your Opti-stretch stretching exercises the
    following day. That is why you always perform a detection (Check and Stretch) and then a gentle warm up (mild
    discomfort) to detect any hidden abnormalities. If you are not performing warm up exercises before attempting 80%
    MAX stretches, you are not doing the Opti-stretch technique properly. You may erroneously conclude that the stretch
    you are doing that morning injured the muscle. While this could be possible, more commonly you will be able to
    recall some unusual activity with that area of the body from the day before. If you do not warm up the muscles
    properly before attempting a moderate discomfort intensity level, you can very easily convert a mild strain into a
    moderate strain.
</p>

<p>
    In either of the three cases above, you have, by definition, sustained an
    <u>acute muscle injury</u>. Stop stretching for at least two days, apply ice, and try to protect the area from overuse. Then
    start carefully resuming the exercises after at least two days rest and only at mild discomfort (50% MAX) intensity.
    Over the next few days, gradually work up your intensity level if you are feeling better.
</p>

<p>
    Moderate or severe injuries are a little more straight forward. Usually, you will have at least some sensation that
    the muscle has been pulled or injured. It may take two to eight hours before a more severe pain begins to set in.
    This is why I have included the following classification of normal healing processes (see next page,
    <u>Table 2</u>).
    By simply judging the amount of pain, you may not be able to determine precisely the extent of an injury.
    However, by measuring the length of time it takes to heal a muscle given optimum care, you can retroactively assess
    more accurately how badly the muscle was injured. This system works well, because we are usually dealing with
    reoccurring strains and
    <u><b>Opti-stretch is not designed for acute injuries</b></u>.
