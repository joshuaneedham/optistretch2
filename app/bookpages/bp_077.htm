<h3>13. THE PSOAS SHORT LEG SYNDROME</h3>

<p>
    In the late 1800’s, the first documentation of widespread leg shortening in the general public was published.
    Research documented that in over 50% of the population in various sample populations, there were individuals with
    one leg shorter than the other. British
    <u>military physicians</u>
    investigated this concept of a shorter leg and the association with a higher incidence of back pain, during the
    1960’s (Nichols, P.J.R., British Medical Journal, 1960, 1, 1863). Published in the British Medical Journal, the
    article was titled the “Short Leg Syndrome”. It described an increased incidence of low back pain in 1000 British
    soldiers with one leg shorter than the other. Several other articles dealt with the correlation of back pain and
    unilateral leg shortening. Most of the data and articles dealing with the short leg syndrome came from England and
    never gained much popularity in the American medical community. However, this concept did gain a degree of
    popularity in the American general public because many sufferers of recurrent back pain knew they had one leg, which
    was shorter than the other.
</p>

<p>
    Another group of British physicians then evaluated soldiers with a device called a “locating jig” and concluded
    “chronic back pain is thus unlikely to be part of the short leg syndrome”. (Lancet, 1984 Aug 4, 2:8397, 256-8.)
    Opti-stretch research suggests that the “locating jig” only demonstrated that the majority of individuals with an
    observable clinical shortening of one leg did
    <b><u>not</u></b>
    have bone length differences. This suggests that the original
    <u>military physicians</u>
    were dealing with some type of functional shortening of one leg. Although, this subject has been referred to by
    various authors, no further scientific research on a “Short Leg Syndrome” has been conducted since that time. It is
    unfortunate that there have been no definitive large population studies with good control groups to either prove or
    disprove the theory of back pain associated with one shorter leg. Opti-stretch theory agrees with and supports the
    published findings of the British military physicians. Careful review of this original literature was extremely
    helpful in leading to some of the new scientific discoveries by Opti-stretch.
</p>

<p>
    The father of modern Pain Management in the USA, Dr. John Bonica, championed the belief that a short leg might be
    associated with severe recurrent back pain. His early career in professional wrestling left him with severe
    recurrent back pain and he did have one leg that was shorter than the other. He was one of the only American
    physicians that publicly even recognized the possibility of a “short-leg syndrome”.
</p>

<p>
    Part of the lack of interest in this concept by the American medical community might have been due to the fact that
    chiropractors have focused on the leg length differences in back pain for at least the last 50 to 100 years. There
    have even been claims of being able to correct some types of leg length shortening. Patients with a leg length
    disparity, which could not be corrected, were sold lifts. Lifts are a heal insole placed in the shoe to compensate
    for the shortening of one leg.
</p>

<p>
    Since the late 1980’s, Orthopedic surgeons have taken a very conservative approach to the problem of one leg being
    shorter than the other and a general tendency not to prescribe lifts. Statistically, at least one in every 100
    individuals has a measurable leg shorter than the other due to
    <u>bone length</u>
    differences. This shortness has been correlated with multiple standard measurement techniques and x-ray
    confirmation. Provided the difference is less than one inch, many of these individuals have no problem with either
    posture or back pain. Opti-stretch research concurs with this data.
</p>

<p>
    In the 1970’s and 1980’s, a lift in one shoe was frequently recommended for a shorter leg by many types of
    physicians. Orthopedic surgeons noted several problems that occurred in the feet and ankles due to chronic lift use.
    Today, insole lifts, on only one side, are recommended much less frequently than in the past.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch research suggests that use of such a lift can help decrease some forms of back pain in the acute phase.
    However, chronic use of such a lift in an active individual can have
    <u>many</u>
    negative side effects. If you are going to consider a lift, it is recommended that an orthopedic surgeon be
    consulted.
</p>

<p>
    Three separate causes have been published for the unilateral leg shortening (anatomical, maximal acute spasm and
    functional) of one leg. The most obvious is that the bone lengths are different for some reason
    (<u>anatomical shortened leg</u>). This occurs quite frequently in approximately 1% of the population. Often, this is considered a congenital
    condition. However, it can also occur with severe trauma to the growth portion of the bone (growth plate) prior to
    adulthood. Significant trauma to this area can prematurely halt future bone growth.
</p>

<p>
    Orthopedic surgeons have reported up to a 2-inch shortening of the leg during
    “<u>maximum psoas spasm</u>”. The exact mechanism as to how the leg shortens has not been completely described in the literature. Severe acute
    maximum spasm of the psoas muscle is quite rare. One medical condition that can cause this maximal spasm is due to a
    psoas abscess. The shortening resolves when the spasm heals.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to an anatomical short leg, there also exists a
    “<u>functional</u> short leg”. This is a shortening of the leg without any difference in respective bone lengths. This
    concept is superficially described in several medical textbooks as a probable contraction of the hip and back
    muscles, which can cause a shortening of the leg. This terminology has gained popularity in the literature since the
    1990’s. While the terminology is used, it is not precisely defined nor are there any generally accepted theories as
    to the cause of the pathophysiology. Even though this phenomenon has been described, no indepth research has yet
    been conducted as to the exact muscles involved and how the condition is best treated. The leg length difference
    reported is usually quite subtle (often a
    <span>1&frasl;4</span>
    inch or less). The exact etiology is still in question but deals with hip and leg rotation causing a functional
    shortening of one leg and a resultant pelvic tilt.
</p>

<p>
    A new fourth cause of leg length discrepancy has been documented by Opti-stretch research. It has been coined as a
    “<u>variable psoas pathology</u>”. The majority of the Optistretch research has focused around this phenomenon. While this is, more than likely, a
    variant of a “functional short leg”, it is placed in a separate category for two reasons. First, it often exceeds
    the 1&frasl;4
    inch described in some medical texts. The second reason is that it has been documented to be able to change length.
    Primarily, it is believed to be due to a chronic partial spasm of the psoas muscle complex. When partial spasm is
    reversed, there can be a residual psoas tendon shortening of less than 1&frasl;4
    inch. It has not been determined whether the prolonged spasm caused the tendon shortening, or whether the tendon
    shortening occurred genetically making the psoas muscle more susceptible to strain injury. Tendon shortening alone
    may behave similarly to the “functional short leg” as described in the medical literature and not necessarily
    contribute to any back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch research suggests that during psoas spasm, the hip joint undergoes a very complex external twisting
    rotation that can leave the leg shortened at the hip joint. This most commonly results in a posterior rotation of
    the pelvis on that side. (However, anterior rotation of the pelvis is occasionally seen.) The pelvis on the
    shortened side then tilts downward, due to pelvic leveling. With certain specific measuring techniques, the leg
    functionally and clinically can be shortened
    1&frasl;2
    to even 1 full inch. Certain coupled stretching positions like the “Standing Squat,” will show the shorter leg to be
    consistently more externally rotated. At this level of chronic muscle spasm, these individuals have an extremely
    high incidence of low back pain and frequently will demonstrate a recurrent back strain syndrome. Indeed,
    Opti-stretch research has shown that the
    <u>majority</u>
    of individuals with all of the various “recurrent back strain syndromes” have this “variable psoas pathology”.
</p>

<p>
    There appears to be various “recurrent back strain syndromes”, which can involve either the neck, upper back or the
    lower back. The most common for the lower back is the “Psoas Short Leg Syndrome”. There is also a variant of this
    condition, seen approximately 10 to15% of the time. The hallmark of this variant is contralateral back pain
    following one or more ipsilateral back pain occurrences. This suggests that the various types of anatomy seen in the
    psoas muscle complex may respond differently to injury. The “rhomboid (upper back) recurrent back strain syndrome”
    is the most frequently syndrome seen in the upper back area. The majority of the time, this syndrome is associated
    with some type of “variable psoas pathology” of one leg. However, there is frequently not any lower back pain
    problems reported by the individual. The neck area generally involves the Trapezius Neck Strain Syndrome. Usually,
    psoas or rhomboid spasm is present, even though there are no reports of any significant “recurrent back strain
    syndromes” of the respective areas. If present, the key is to rehabilitate first the lower back and then the upper
    back. At this point, the neck muscles can be much more easily returned to a healthy condition.
</p>

<p>
    Individuals with a “variable psoas pathology” also appear to have a high incidence of a hip click on this shortened
    side. A hip click is the snapping noise in the hip area when
    the leg is moved directly out to the side. I was 13 years old when I first noticed this popping noise in my right
    hip. Like many people in the 1960’s, I was told this was a sign of hip damage and would probably lead to hip
    replacement at an early age unless I limited my activity. A sage father told me that he would “rather wear it out,
    rather than rust it out.” This advice proved very valuable.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately in the 1980’s, this problem of hip click was researched with ultrasound. It was shown conclusively to be
    a noise created by the snapping of the psoas minor or iliopsoas ligaments over the pelvic brim and had nothing to
    due with the hip joint. The pain in the hip appeared to be some type of referred pain. The final medical conclusion
    was that a hip click was a “completely benign process”. However, the fact that the snap or click generally only
    exists on one side and not on the other, suggests something may not be quite right.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch research suggests that one possibility is a tightening of the psoas complex due to chronic spasm. The
    other possibility may be due to psoas tendon shortening. Individuals with hip clicks who repetitively engage in
    activities like martial arts, dance or rock climbing will frequently notice an increased soreness of that hip (due
    to radiated pain). Occasionally, groin pain will be reported. With proper Opti-stretch toning of the tight psoas
    complex, both the snap and discomfort from overuse can be significantly decreased. Unfortunately, seldom is this hip
    click noise completely eliminated.
</p>

<p>
    If the chronically spasmed muscles can regain normal health, a large portion of the shortening can be reversed.
    However, if the tendon of the psoas complex (iliopsoas) has shortened, it appears that lengthening the tendon is at
    best extremely difficult and most likely not possible. Modern medicine teaches that other than surgery, tendon
    lengthening is virtually impossible. In this type of condition, it is imperative to maintain healthy muscle tone of
    the psoas complex muscles in order to prevent both injury and reinjury.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, a large portion of the population has some type of measurable shortness of one leg (possibly up to 50 to
    80%). Three separate causes of a short leg have been reported to exist (anatomical bone shortening, severe acute
    spasm of the psoas muscle and functional shortening). The anatomical short leg, where bone length is unequal, is
    quite common. Good clinical studies and Opti-stretch research both suggest there appears to be no significant
    increase in back pain associated with an anatomically shortened leg of less than approximately one inch. Whenever a
    leg is shorter, there is a lateral tilting of the pelvis. Without some type of compensation, the whole upper body
    would then tilt to one side. The spine responds by forming a rotational scoliosis or curvature of the spine, which
    can be either an S-shape or a C-shape.
</p>

<p>
    If all the muscles of the back are healthy, the rotational scoliosis compensation occurs in the lumbar (lower) area
    of the spine. Due to the anatomy of the vertebrae in the lumbar region, rotational scoliosis can be very effectively
    compensated for and with minimal noticeable anatomic changes. However, if the psoas muscle complex of the
</p>

<p>
    lower spine is in some type of tightness or chronic spasm, the rotational scoliosis will then be compensated for
    primarily in the thoracic spine. The thoracic area of the spine area, due to the anatomy of the vertebrae, poorly
    compensates for rotational scoliosis. This frequently leads to a noticeable shoulder drop on one side or a
    significant kyphosis (hunchback). These two conditions are associated with the majority of the upper back and neck
    recurrent back strain syndromes that have been observed in the Opti-stretch research.
</p>

<p>
    With regards to a “functional short leg,” there exists at least some correlation from British studies that this
    particular condition may be associated with back pain problems. Opti-stretch research not only suggests that a
    chronic condition of leg shortening can exist due to chronic spasm and pathology of the psoas complex, but a true
    <u>syndrome</u>
    of various symptoms can be identified depending on the amount and severity of recurrent low back strains. Therefore,
    the term of a “psoas short leg syndrome” has been proposed and appears to be the major cause of recurrent low back
    strain. If there is documented functional shortening of less than
    1&frasl;4
    to
    1&frasl;2
    inch and if there are no recurrent back pain symptoms despite an active lifestyle, this condition is referred to as
    a “<u>psoas short leg trait</u>”. This condition has been found in individuals with extremely healthy backs and often in the “never any back pain”
    group.
</p>

<p>
    In my own experience, a 1-inch shortened right leg was diagnosed by an Orthopedic Surgeon at a premier Sports
    Medicine Clinic in the Northwest. I was given the choice of wearing a
    1&frasl;2 inch insole (the largest lift that can be safely placed in a shoe) or the more recommended choice of building the
    sole of my right shoe up from the bottom by one inch. As I was having no problems at the time, I obviously chose the
    1&frasl;2
    inch custom insole lift and wore this type of lift religiously for 17 years. It was especially problematic for high
    performance ski boots, other high-tech athletic footwear and obeying the rule of having to take my shoes off, when I
    came into the house.
</p>

<p>
    Following six months of Opti-stretch, the right leg length difference was only
    3&frasl;16<sup>th</sup> of an inch and the lift was discontinued. The 1-inch difference did return on two separate occasions following
    significant injuries to the left hamstring. The shortening of the right leg was not readily noticeable. Due to the
    prolonged healing of the left hamstring injury, the shortening of the right leg was fortuitously detected. The right
    leg difference returned to
    3&frasl;16<sup>th</sup>
    of an inch over a few weeks with Opti-stretch therapy. After happening a second time, it became apparent that the
    right leg shortening was extremely insidious, and appeared to influence the course of healing on the opposite limb.
    Optistretch research has shown that psoas injury, resultant spasm and consequential shortening of the one leg is a
    hallmark of the “psoas short leg syndrome” and the associated recurrent back strain episodes.
</p>

<p>
    Also, this data supports that less than 1&frasl;4 to 1&frasl;2
    inch difference in leg length can be compatible with a very healthy back if the muscles are optimally toned. After
    the above two experiences, a reliable method of simple documentation of any leg length difference
    was then developed. This method of leg measurement is called a Height-o-gram and is described in Appendix A.
</p>

<p>
    The following sections of this book describe in detail, the incredible complexity of psoas muscle complex anatomy
    and physiology. Also, additional research and discovery are presented, supporting the association between the psoas
    muscle complex and recurrent back strain.
