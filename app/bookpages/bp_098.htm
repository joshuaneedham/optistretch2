<p>
    Injections are not necessary for success in the Opti-stretch program. However, there may be a small percentage of
    the population who might be significantly helped by this technique.

<p>
    In brief, this is a standard steroid injection with the proportions of ingredients described in prolotherapy
    injections. Injections are performed with a 2 cc amount of solution with a 23 gauge, 1
    1&frasl;2
    inch needle. The first injection is performed both directly through and no more than 2 centimeters anterior to the
    sacrolumbar ligament. The second is transabdominal but definitely not transperitoneal into iliacus muscle 4 cm below
    the anterior superior iliac spine. The third injection is into the iliopsoas muscle at the level of the anterior
    inferior iliac spine. Again, it is extremely important
    <u>not</u>
    to use a transperitoneal approach. The fourth is into the gluteus medius muscle and deep hip flexor at 2-cm superior
    to the most superior aspect of the greater trochanter. No more than 1-inch depth of needle insertion is utilized to
    insure no involvement with the hip joint.

<p>
    Originally, a fifth area was attempted. This was into the iliopsoas muscle at the level of the groin. However, due
    to the lidocaine with epinephrine solution, the anterior cutaneous femoral nerve was frequently anesthetized. More
    importantly, the cutaneous anesthesia would resolve before the complete proprioception had returned to the knee.
    This made ambulation possible but any additional stress could tend to make the knee give away until the anesthetic
    effects of the injection had completely dissipated. The risk of a patient falling was not worth the benefit seen and
    only the four injections in the preceding paragraph were used.

<p>
    At some point in time this injection technique may deserve some formal study and investigational trials.
