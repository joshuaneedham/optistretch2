		<li>There is a significant amount of left shoulder anterior rotation. (Notice how the left hand has moved in front of
    the left leg.) The right hip appears slightly shorter at the belt line. Note that the shoulder height is roughly the
    same given the anterior rotation of the left shoulder.</li>
		<li>The tips of the thumbs are placed on the anterior superior iliac spines. A significant lowering of the right hip
    area can be seen.</li>

    Note: Precise measurements are difficult from photography alone due to the complex combinations of movement in the
    human body. The photograph converts a 3 dimensional image into a 2 dimensional image making subtle anterior
    rotations appear slightly larger.

    Conservative walking activity was all Blake was comfortable with due to the pain. Due to the acute injury,
    Opti-stretch exercises were not recommended. By six weeks, he gradually reported feeling back to normal. However, he
    was still unable to get comfortably down into a squatting position (something easily performed prior to the injury).
    At eight weeks, the squatting position had returned to normal, yet he still had mild back discomfort on trying to
    perform a bridge. Over the next couple of weeks he resumed playing both football and tennis. A month later, the
    bridge was completed without back discomfort.

    In the young healthy 18-year-old athlete, the problem partially corrected itself with the healing of the back
    injury. Unknown to either one of us was the significant drop in
