<h3>1. BASICS OF BACK STRAIN</h3>

<p>
    The two muscles of major interest are the psoas muscle of the low back and the rhomboid muscles of the upper back.
    These two core muscle groups are responsible for the majority of recurrent back strain episodes. Different methods
    to best rehabilitate these muscles were experimented with. Stretching exercises proved beneficial, not only for
    improving tone, but also for isolating the muscle or muscle groups. This allowed a system for determining risk
    factors. It also allowed for being able to measure accurately the increase in muscle tone.
</p>

<p>
    The <u>Advanced Program</u>
    was developed. It is a collection of special complex exercises that certain active individuals, under the age of 35,
    could do rather easily. This group was also unique in that the majority had never experienced any type of
    significant back pain in their entire lives. In contrast, individuals who suffered from a history of recurrent back
    problems were unable to complete these stretching exercises. The exam was evaluated on individuals between the ages
    of 3 and 73. Over 95% of all healthy “3 to 5” year olds could pass these screening exercises. The percentage then
    falls precipitously over each half decade of life.
</p>

<p>
    The Advanced Program was designed around the knowledge of the “never any back pain” group. Regarding the general
    population, these stretching exercises seem extremely simple to some; to others, they appear rather impossible.
    Indeed, from an anatomy and physiology point of view, these stretching exercises are rather complex. There are
    <u>multiple reasons</u>
    why an individual may not be able to pass the exam; some have nothing to do with the back. However, those who could
    pass the exam, demonstrated a much lower incidence of back problems in all age groups, especially age 35 and above.
    Those who could not pass the Advanced Program the first time around, due to back problems, and then worked on the
    Intermediate Therapeutic Program for 2 to 6 months were pleased. By the time they could pass the Advanced Program,
    many had noted significant decreases in their back pain problems. A long term, less demanding maintenance program
    could then be implemented.

    The Opti-stretch
    <u>therapeutic programs</u>
    for old and young use the best stretching exercises out of more than 350 published stretching exercises. The
    technique of stretch receptor lengthening should only be used on the stretching exercises presented in this book.
    The technique must be performed very precisely, in order to both achieve optimum results and to avoid possible
    injury to the muscles. As muscles become more toned, it has been demonstrated that joint movement and posture can
    improve. The new measurement techniques are simple, yet extremely accurate. This allows for better tracking of
    progress, which assures that the individual is performing the therapeutic programs properly. It also aids in goal
    setting, and makes the stretching exercises more informative and fun.
</p>

<p>
    Stretching exercises in Western Cultures have only become popular in the last 65 years. Some Middle Eastern and
    Eastern cultures have experience with stretching techniques that date back over 2000 years. Stretching exercises
    have proven to be a valuable tool to help maintain muscle tone and for helping to warm up muscles (especially in
    individuals over age 35).
</p>

<p>
    In the USA, most individuals who are presently under the age of 55 have received at least some instruction, in
    either school classes or sports as to the value of stretching. Unfortunately, many learn to stretch with excessive
    intensity of force that actually inhibits stretch receptor lengthening, promotes injury and causes a discomfort that
    makes stretching unappealing for later life. The precise incidence of individuals using some type of stretching
    program is difficult to determine. In the individuals questioned, the incidence was very low.
</p>

<p>
    Two popular types of stretching programs in adults were found. First, was a daily program. This was popular in
    people who had sustained a musculo-skeletal back injury. However, they often reported muscle tightening and return
    of the back pain, if only a few days or weeks of regular exercise were missed. Second, was a stretching program
    performed prior to intense physical activity. These individuals are commonly referred to as “weekend warriors”.
    Often their job responsibilities preclude an active lifestyle during the week. However, on the weekends and
    vacations, very physical activities like skiing, rock climbing or aggressive yard work are performed. A fairly high
    percentage of these “weekend warriors”, over 35, have at least some type of either stretching or other warm-up
    program, prior to engaging in physical activity.
</p>

<p>
    Hopefully, this widespread disinterest in stretching exercises by the general public will change when individuals
    discover the amount of important knowledge that can be gained by completing the Opti-stretch program. The
    therapeutic programs are designed for 20 minutes each day for 2 to 6 months. Unfortunately, the older the individual
    and the longer the muscles have had problems, the longer it takes to remedy the problem. The major goal is to
    correct risk factors for recurrent back strain. Once goals are reached, many find they can change to a 2 to 3 times
    per week program or even just periodic checks as a screening and diagnostic tool. A lot depends on the type of risk
    factors and the type of active lifestyle the individual maintains. If risk factors can be completely eliminated,
    muscle tone can often be maintained for prolonged periods by an active lifestyle and regaining “involuntary
    stretching” (see Section 7). It is important to at least periodically check to ensure the level of muscle tone is
    not decreasing.
</p>

<p>
    The major goal of Opti-stretch is to detect unhealthy muscles and restore the proper elasticity and tone to the
    muscle fibers. An unhealthy muscle is one that has some element of tightness or spasm in the muscle. This is usually
    a residual effect of an injury to the muscle that has caused some degree of spasm in the muscle. Toning the muscles
    is only part of the process for maintaining healthy muscles. Once muscles are toned, the next two steps are to
    strengthen and condition the muscles. To review the next steps of strengthening and conditioning muscles, I completed a
    Certified Personal Fitness Trainer course. There are many excellent programs to choose from, in order to strengthen
    the muscles. Fewer programs deal with the conditioning of muscles, especially for amateurs and adults.
</p>

<p>
    Good programs generally stress the importance of stretching. However, there doesn’t appear to be any packaged
    program quite like Opti-stretch for both detecting risk factors and then effectively decreasing the risk factors
    through muscle toning.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch is a very new program. Because certain new medical discoveries contradicted generally accepted medical
    dogma, five years were spent working with these concepts and only on select individuals. All have noted improvement
    in back pain, muscle function and fewer recurrences of muscle strain. Some have experienced dramatic improvement and
    have even described the results as a “fountain of youth”. The program was designed for both safety and efficiency.
    Because of the complexity of the stretching exercises, isolation of specific problematic muscles, and the new
    techniques used, injuries while performing the stretching exercises are still possible, if the basic concepts are
    not properly understood. The program must be followed very precisely to avoid injuries.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch was designed for essentially healthy individuals and those without significant medical problems. Anyone
    with medical problems, over the age of 35 or any history of serious back injuries needs to have a medical evaluation
    prior to even trying the program. For the past six years, I have experimented with aspects of this program. Many of
    the theories were tested and retested to assure long-term viability, time efficiency and safety. However, like many
    things in life, there are no guarantees. You need to be aware that there may be medical risks to certain types of
    individuals. Always read the exercise carefully before attempting any stretching exercise. An experienced fitness
    instructor is extremely beneficial. Unless you are generally healthy and accept that there may be risks in
    performing these stretching exercises, please do not attempt the exercises without an instructor.
</p>

<p>
    Preventable recurrent back problems and risk factors
    <u>can be identified</u>. By maximizing muscle tone, many young and old alike can be spared the needless decrease in
    activity levels that can accompany “Benign Back Pain”. Significant pain and suffering for millions of individuals
    can now be avoided. Please evaluate the Opti-stretch program. Any constructive criticism and ideas for future
    evolution of this new program are welcome.
