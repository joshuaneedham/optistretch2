	<li>Back pain has now reached epidemic proportions and needlessly millions of lives are negatively effected.<br><br></li>
	<li>If you are above age 30 and have <u>never</u>
    experienced back pain you are likely in the 20% of the population that probably will not have any back pain in their
    entire lifetime. (A tremendous <u>genetic benefit</u>)<br><br></li>
    <li>However, if you have experienced two or more episodes of a strained back in precisely the same place, you have by
    definition “<u>recurrent back pain</u>”. Even one episode of
    <u>severe low back pain</u> can place you in a high-risk category for “recurrent back pain”.<br><br></li>
	<li>If you have several <u>risk factors</u>, the likelihood of recurrences of back pain is extremely high, depending on the activity level
		of the lifestyle that you choose.<br><br></li>
	<li>Now there is a <u>screening test</u>
		that will help you to determine how healthy your back really is.<br><br></li>
	<li>The <u>Opti-stretch Screening Exam</u>
    will allow you to identify the risk factors for recurrent back pain that you might have. The exam is both for adults
    and children.<br><br></li>
	<li>The self-assessment Opti-stretch screening exam is reliable for most healthy individuals. However, a qualified
    instructor to administer the exam is even a better option. They can tell you with over a 90% probability whether you
    have a healthy back.<br><br></li>
	<li>By decreasing or eliminating the <u>risk factors</u>
    for recurrent back pain through the Opti-stretch stretching exercises you can significantly improve your back
    problems.<br><br></li>
    <li>It doesn’t happen overnight and in many cases takes six months of hard work.<br><br></li>
    <li>Don’t let a bad back determine your activity level and lifestyle!<br><br></li>
	<li>Take it from someone who has been there, the time and effort is definitely
	<u>worth it</u>.</li>
