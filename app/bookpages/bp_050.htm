    While the Advanced Program is quite simple for children and fit athletes, it can be very physically demanding for
    older individuals. For this reason a physical exam is needed beyond age 35 and those with any medical illness should
    not perform these exercises. For those who can, the exercises represent an excellent benchmark for muscle tone. Most
    are checked periodically. The Intermediate Program is designed to prepare you.

    I perform the “Bridge” a couple times a month. It should be noted that in some university swimming programs, the
    “Bridge” is now discouraged for daily use, because “it can hurt the back”. There are many exercises like this that
    have been discouraged or even stopped in public physical education classes for this reason. However, certain
    individuals can perform these exercises daily without ever hurting their backs. This suggests that it is not the
    exercise, but the baseline muscle tone of the individual. If psoas muscles are targeted using extreme exercises,
    before first toning the surrounding larger muscles, this can definitely lead to back pain (i.e., the bent-knee
    sit-up with the hands behind the head, and using a jerking motion can put a tremendous stress directly on the psoas
    muscles).

    The “
    <span>Standing Squat”</span>
    is the one single exercise that seems to have the highest correlation with having a healthy back (especially in
    men). I perform it daily, but still have trouble with it due to tightened soleus muscles (in the calf), and the
    shortened psoas tendon.

    The “Prone Knee to Cross Chest” is excellent and can be used instead of other pyriformis stretches. Tested regularly
    are the “Supine Feet Apart”, and the “Second Position”. However, the “Supine Ankles to Pelvis” is diagnostic only
    and can cause knee pain with daily use.
