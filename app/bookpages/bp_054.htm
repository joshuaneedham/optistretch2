	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_066.png"/>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>While lying on the back place your hands over your head and place the hands close to the shoulders and flat on
    the floor. Using the strength of the arms, slowly arch the back into the air. Often it is necessary to reposition
    the arms while resting some weight on the head. When repositioned, using only the arms, elevate the body into the
    bridge position.</li>	
	</ol>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Always use a <u>qualified spotter</u>! The spotter should not help by lifting the body. They should only protect you from falling if your hands slip.</li>
		<li>By age 3, most all children can easily perform this stretching exercise. Many sports such as swimming, diving, gymnastics and dance regularly teach 3 year olds this exercise.</li>
		<li>Only about 50% of school age children can perform this exercise. Only 20% of adults can perform this.</li>
		<li>This exercise significantly stretches the psoas muscle complex of the low back. The exercise is particularly hard to do with recurrent back problems.</li>
		<li>Additionally, good range of motion of the wrists and shoulders is essential. Some individuals will have adequate range of motion of the low back but due to wrist and shoulder problems
			will have difficulty with this exercise.</li>
		<li>Upper body strength to body weight ratio is also accessed.</li>
		<li>It is a great exercise if your joints are healthy.</li>
		<li>This is not intended as a daily exercise but as a check to evaluate the above muscles and joints usually 2 â€“3 times per month.</li>
