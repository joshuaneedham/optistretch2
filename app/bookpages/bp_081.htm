    This variation in the presence or absence of the psoas minor muscle is likely to be genetically linked. A commonly
    reported anatomical occurrence is when the psoas minor is absent, oftentimes a portion of the psoas major splits off
    and attaches to the pubic bone before entering the inguinal canal. The exact incidence has not been reported.
    Presumably, this variation is an attempt by the body to replace the missing psoas minor muscle.

<p>
    Although more variations have been reported, there are at least three distinct anatomical forms the psoas muscle
    complex can exist in.
</p>
<ol type="A" style="font-weight:bold;">
	<li>Psoas major only.</li>
	<li>Psoas major where a portion splits off and attaches to where the psoas minor would normally have attached.
			<span style="font-weight:normal;">
				(Note: this condition is reported but not significantly  studied  to  determine  the  exact  percentages.)
			</span></li>
	<li>Psoas major and minor muscles present together (considered to be normal anatomy in humans).</li>
</ol>

    This means that some of the muscles of the Psoas Complex aren’t even there half the time. For this reason, medical
    students are taught that the psoas complex has little function in back performance. There are other muscles in the
    body that are only present
    in half the population (i.e., pyramidalis, peroneus tertius, palmaris longus, and the plantaris). Each of the
    above mentioned muscles are much smaller muscles compared with the psoas complex. The classic muscle is the palmaris
    longus muscle of the forearm. In fact, I was taught in medical school that the only known function of the palmaris
    longus muscle was to provide tendon material so that plastic surgeons could operate. Opti-stretch theory suggests
    that the function of the psoas complex is grossly underestimated when it comes to back pain.

    Opti-stretch research also suggests that the right side of the body is more commonly associated with
    <u>severe</u>
    recurrent back pain problems. The reason for this is unclear, but could possibly be associated with a dominant right
    hand or leg.

    Assuming that the conditions A, B, and C above are roughly similar in proportion, and the side it occurs on is
    important, this would make nine possible anatomical combinations. If we then assume that the most stable back
    structures are those where the exact anatomy exists on both sides, there is only a 33% chance of not having back
    pain. Remember that these are only hypothetical assumptions.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch research has shown that there is a significant difference in the length when two tendons come off the
    distal psoas complex. It is assumed that the longer tendon on either the iliacus or psoas major may be more prone to
    tendon shortening and perpetuating a chronic injury state in the psoas complex. (Tendon shortening is, as previously
    stated, a significant clinical problem.) If you assume that only those individuals with completely identical anatomy
    on each side are less susceptible to injury, then approximately 17-33 % of the population would theoretically have
    low chance of having back pain. Factoring in serious back injury, these numbers are very close to the 20% of
    individuals in the United States population that never suffer from back pain. This suggests a population that, due
    to anatomy, is essentially “immune” from back pain unless affected by severe trauma or significant pathology. This
    group may also completely heal injured psoas major muscles without the formation of chronically injured muscles
    (ACIMs). These results also provide a hypothetical model as to why there are so many different forms of benign back
    pain (mild, moderate, and severe) and amount of injury, when the relative lifting or twisting stresses are often
    quite similar.
