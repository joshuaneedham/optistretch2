    <p>a. &nbsp;In the supine position, grab either the calf or the thigh (preferably the calf) of the right leg.
        Keep the knee straight.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Attempt to bring the knee to the nose.</p>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat for the left leg.</li>
        <li>This is the stretch that will allow you to start into the Intermediate Therapeutic Exercises
            with “Sitting Nose to Knee” (Figure Four).
        </li>
        <li>This is a very good exercise to use for helping to determine the force intensity, which will
            cause a moderate discomfort level of stretch.
        </li>
        <li>The nose to knee should be within about a foot before progressing to the “Sitting Nose to
            Knee” position.
        </li>
        <li>Remember, it is important to keep the knee fully extended.</li>
        <li>Another way to do the exercise is to leave the knee partially bent. Then slowly straighten
            the knee to perform the stretch. This is an excellent exercise for quadriceps strengthening.
