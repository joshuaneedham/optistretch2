    <h3>1. SITTING NOSE TO KNEE - (FIGURE FOUR)</h3>
	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_063.png"/>
    <ol type="a">
	    <li>Sit with the left leg extended. The right knee is bent with the arch of the right foot touching
	    	the bulge on the inside of the left knee.</li>
	    <li>Slowly touch the nose to the knee.</li>
	    <li>Individuals, ages 8 to 51, are shown in this figure.</li>
	</ol>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Repeat for the right side of the body.</li>
		<li>This should be both a relatively easy position to obtain and quite comfortable. Both the
			left and right stretches should be to equal length.</li>
		<li>You should be able to at least bring the nose within 4 inches of the knee before proceeding
	on to the rest of the advanced stretches.</li>
		<li>Often in Yoga, the left foot is placed against the right thigh. In martial arts, the left foot is
placed on the calf. If you are used to one way, still perform the stretch as described in
Opti-stretch with the arch of the left foot over the bulge of the right knee. This has been
found to be the best way to tone the hamstrings for further Opti-stretch exercises.</li>
    </ol>
