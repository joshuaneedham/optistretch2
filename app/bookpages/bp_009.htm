    Recurrent strains of the back, usually over time, localize to one side or the other; while many of the less serious
    strains are located near the midline of the back. The most common strain of the low back is felt near the midline
    just above the pelvis. This is usually either a mild or moderate type of strain. It usually appears due to lifting
    with the back instead of with the legs. The average 175-pound male can lie on his back and lift over 500 pounds with
    the strength of his legs. However, while standing and lifting an object with both the legs and the back in the
    proper squat lifting position, he can only lift 250 pounds. In a standing position with the knees kept completely
    straight (straight-leg dead-lift), an individual lifts only with the back muscles. This same 175pound male can
    usually only lift 50-75 pounds comfortably.
</p>

<p>
    Most professional weight lifters will exercise and strengthen their back with the straight-leg dead-lift exercise
    but rarely will they push this exercise to extreme limits like the other exercises mentioned above. They are
    rightfully concerned about hurting their backs. Unfortunately, many health care workers, firefighters, rescue
    workers and blue-collar workers frequently must perform this type of suboptimal lifting in an emergency situation.
    Lifting with mostly the back muscles and little of the leg muscles will commonly injure this area of the low back.
</p>

<p>
    Other frequent causes of midline low-back injury are repetitive bending or working in the bent-over position much of
    the day. Either or both of these activities will commonly lead to mild strains of the low back in the midline. This
    usually involves the major back muscles called the erector spinae muscles.
</p>

<p>
    Another common cause of midline back pain is strain to the interspinous ligament. This condition usually involves a
    very specific type of injury to ligaments connected to the spine. The injury seldom takes over two weeks to heal.
    Rarely is there a recurrent problem, unless the same forces are again delivered to the low back.
</p>

<p>
    However, “recurrent low back strain” is quite a different process, especially when strains are severe. This strain
    usually happens while lifting a heavy object or even lifting a light object while twisting. The pain can be
    immediate or it can merely feel like a moderately pulled muscle in the low back. Within 2 to 6 hours, the pain
    progressively becomes excruciating. During the excruciating phase of the pain, which lasts for several days, the
    pain is felt in a large band of the low back. Walking is barely possible and no position of comfort can be found,
    even while lying down. As the pain slowly eases, the individual can begin to walk with minimal discomfort. At this
    time, the pain generally localizes to either the left or right side over the sacroiliac area of the spine. The
    midline can still be tender, but is usually not the primary focal area of the pain. The most common way to make the
    pain worse is performing even a slight backward bending of the low back.
</p>

<p>
    The severity of the pain will usually cause the individual to seek medical evaluation on the first couple of
    occasions. Due to the 4 to 8 weeks of pain and limited physical activity, it is usually an event that is remembered
    by most patients. Many individuals rank the pain on the same level as a broken bone or major surgery. The problem
    with this particular injury is that in various stages, it keeps reoccurring after years of being dormant. Also, the
    amount of force to the back, which will cause the problem to reoccur, becomes less and less with each new injury.
    Often, something as minor as twisting backwards to pick up a paper clip which is slightly behind them, will cause a
    recurrent injury that can take weeks to heal. Because the pain location is almost always in exactly the same area,
    the individual can usually differentiate whether the pain is simply a reoccurrence of their usual back pain, or
    whether it is a new and different injury.
</p>

<p>
    Often, in more severe strains, there are other associated muscles and muscle groups that are also painful (i.e.,
    accessory or antagonistic muscles). This phenomenon helps to confirm the involvement of the psoas muscle complex in
    this type of injury. The psoas muscle complex is one of the most complicated muscle groups in the human body.
    Anatomically, there is a
    <u>psoas major muscle</u>, a fusion with the <u>iliacus muscle</u> to form the <u>iliopsoas muscle</u> and a
    completely separate <u>psoas minor muscle</u>, which all form the
    <strong><em>psoas muscle complex</em></strong>. A more complete description and photos are found in the Scientific
    Considerations #14. The Psoas Muscle.
</p>

<p>
    A muscle that is tender to the touch is an indication there is some type of injury. Tenderness of the <u>upper psoas
    muscle area</u> (see Figure 2 – Anterior Back Anatomy) can be demonstrated in a few certain body types by touching
    the muscle. Due to the location deep in the abdomen, the significant pressure that must be placed on the abdominal
    contents and the amount of adipose tissue in this area, the muscle can seldom be palpated and only in certain body
    types. This is a very uncomfortable area to palpate (touch) and best performed by the individual themselves.
</p>

<p>
    The best way to find the area is to tighten the stomach muscles. Between the belly button and upper part of the
    pelvis the outside edge of the rectus abdominus muscles can be felt. Using both hands on each side of the abdomen,
    you slowly and gently massage deeper until touching on either side of the spine. If one side is consistently more
    tender this is a good indicator the psoas muscle complex on that side is involved. Remember that there is only about
    a 5 to 10% chance that you have the thin body type that allows this type of pressure directly on the psoas. Push
    slowly and carefully making sure not to press too hard.
</p>

<p>
    The <u>iliacus muscle</u> is somewhat easier to feel. With both thumbs pressing at the same time in order to compare
    sides, the anterior part of iliac muscle on the inside part of the pelvic bone can be felt. In a chronic injury of
    the psoas complex, one side is often more tender than the other.
</p>

<p>
    The <u>upper iliopsoas muscle</u> (another part of the psoas complex) is very easily palpated in the area of the
    arrow seen in (Figure 2). The fingers can easily feel the 1-1&frasl;2 inch wide muscle in this location. The large
    femoral nerve runs in conjunction with this muscle. Therefore, enough pressure will normally cause this muscle to
    feel uncomfortable. That is why both sides need to be pushed on, at the same time and in precisely the same
    location, in order to determine, if one side is more tender than the other.

<p>
    The groin region is mentioned because injuries to the psoas complex after the muscle leaves the retroperitoneal
    space of the abdominal cavity may manifest themselves by unilateral tenderness in this area. This is referred to as
    a “pulled groin” and is often seen in runners.
</p>

<p>
    Another rare injury in runners is abdominal pain following severe overexertion while running. Frequently they will
    have severe upper abdominal pain lasting days. When they return to running, the pain tends to reoccur on a mild but
    uncomfortable basis for weeks. The only other area of noticeable discomfort is in the groin area and is frequently
    treated as a pulled groin by sports trainers. It is now believed this may actually be an anterior strain injury to
    the upper psoas muscle. In this area the psoas muscle is outside of the upper retroperitoneal space. The associated
    tightness and discomfort of the iliopsoas muscle in the groin area, is due to general tightness along the entire
    psoas complex and is noticed where the iliopsoas leaves the lower part of the retroperitoneal space.
</p>

<p>
    The lower iliopsoas muscle is felt just to the outside (lateral) of the large pulsating artery in the groin. Due to
    large nerves and blood vessels that are normally tender to palpation, you must compare each side at the same time
    and in the same place. Like the other muscles, if there is a difference you will definitely feel it. If you have a
    hard time deciding which side is more tender, this usually means both sides are the same.
</p>

<p>
    The hip area is an extremely common place for lower back pain problems to manifest themselves and is more frequently
    seen in females. During the healing phase of a
    <u>severe</u>
    back strain, most people will remember one hip being more tender than the other to sleep on. In a few individuals,
    mildly injured hip muscles can become quite painful for long periods of time. It is associated with chronic injury
    to the psoas complex.
</p>

<p>
    The hip area is frequently difficult to assess, especially in females. The easiest way is to slowly walk in place.
    Starting at the mid part of the thigh and along the outside edge, the bone called the femur can usually be felt. In
    1 to 2 inch distances, keep feeling toward the hip. At some point, you will begin feeling muscle and the bone moving
    below. Feel the area
    1&frasl;2
    to 1 inch toward the back of this point and toward the direction of the buttocks. This is the insertion point of
    some of the major hip flexors of the pelvis (superior and inferior gamellus, quadratus, pyriformis, obturator
    externis and gluteus medius). Due to certain nerves and ligaments, this area must be felt on both sides at the same
    time and in the same place, to determine if there is any tenderness in this area. At times, the muscles can become
    so inflamed that this area can appear much like a hip bursitis.
</p>

<p>
    The most common upper back injury is located between the shoulder blades and frequently involves the rhomboid
    muscles (see Figure 1 – Posterior Back Anatomy, page 16). Usually the symptoms are localized to only one side. A
    deep massage of the area or performing the Rhomboid Pull stretching exercise will frequently demonstrate that this
    particular muscle group is more tender on one side than the other.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, neck pain can be very complex and can have many different causes other than primary muscle strain.
    The most common location of the pain is usually along the trapezius muscle. While the mid point of the muscle is the
    area most commonly involved, any point along the entire muscle can manifest a chronic muscle injury state.
    Frequently, tenderness and knots called “trigger points” can easily be felt. The most common cause is some type of
    strain to the neck. The second most common cause is the neck muscle’s response to lower or upper back chronic muscle
    injury. That is why the lower and upper back chronic injury conditions must be first healed, before any significant
    healing of the neck area will generally occur.
