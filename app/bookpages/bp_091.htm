<h3>21. POSTURE</h3>
<p>
    Besides improving recurrent back pain problems, the most exciting results from Optistretch have been the improvement
    in posture. Posture is again a very complex subject and can have many causes for any given abnormality. Many people
    usually do not pay much attention to posture unless the individual they see has either very good posture or very
    poor posture. Frequently an individual is unaware that they are beginning to develop noticeably poor posture.
</p>

<p>
    A common type of poor posture is the rounding of the shoulders forward. This is generally due to a kyphosis or
    forward rounding of the upper back. The head is then generally carried in a forward tilt position. There are several
    causes of this problem. One is a true scoliosis of the spine. Another is due to a “rotational” scoliosis of the
    spine. A common cause of a rotational scoliosis is functional shortening of one leg. While insole lifts tend to help
    the problem somewhat, the condition frequently progresses to the point that in old age, it can be a serious problem.
    Gravity and the normal aging process both make the problem more severe.

    Another very common problem with posture is the drop of one shoulder. Determination of this problem was previously
    described. If looked for, it can usually be both easily seen and precisely measured.
</p>

<p>
    An interesting occurrence is that frequently individuals with even 1 full inch of “bone shortening” of the leg do
    not exhibit rounding of the shoulders or a drop in height of one shoulder. In fact, athletic individuals with 1 inch
    of bone shortening often have extremely good posture.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch theory suggests that leg shortening due to psoas tightening (“variable psoas pathology”) causes
    different forces to be exerted on the spine. In individuals with an anatomical short leg, the major part of the
    rotation of the spine occurs in the lower back area, which is structured to compensate for this rotational stress.
    However, with functional shortening and the associated psoas tightness and tenderness, the lower back does not
    rotate as much. The psoas extends all the way up to T11 which is in the mid back area. This lack of rotation in the
    lower back therefore places the rotational forces on the upper spine and stress on the shoulders. The upper back and
    neck vertebrae do not accommodate well to these rotational forces. Therefore, these forces cause an increased
    rounding of the upper spine and dropping of one shoulder. This condition can contribute to upper back and neck
    recurrent strains.
</p>

<p>
    If permanent changes have not occurred, the posture is often remarkably improved following completion of the
    Opti-stretch program. The rounding of the upper back and shoulders can actually return to a near normal appearance
    even after 25 years of having rounded shoulders. The head tilt is also significantly lessened. One thing is certain.
    If you have poor posture and it hasn’t been improved or corrected by Opti-stretch, a medical evaluation is probably
    recommended.

<p>
    If you ever have been told to stand up straight by your mother, or by a friend that thinks you may be slouching a
    little, consider lateral photographs and shoulder height determinations to demonstrate your normal posture. If there
    is a problem, see if you can improve it with Opti-stretch.
