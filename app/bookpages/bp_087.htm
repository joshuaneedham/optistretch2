<h3>15. UPPER BACK PAIN AND THE RHOMBOID MUSCLES</h3>


<p>
    This topic was covered previously. Briefly, the rhomboid area is the area most commonly associated with recurrent
    upper back pain. If someone deeply massages between the shoulder blades, the difference in tenderness can often be
    felt. By performing the rhomboid pull about as strong as one can, this will produce muscle tenderness on the
    chronically injured side. The rhomboid muscles are difficult to stretch due to the shoulder girdle. Therefore, the
    muscles may be toned by isotonic and isometric contraction. Tightening these muscles and pulling the shoulder blades
    together is one of the most consistent types of involuntary stretches seen in man.

<h3>16. NECK PAIN AND THE TRAPEZIUS MUSCLES</h3>
<p>
	The neck stretching exercises presented in Opti-stretch are quite basic but very effective in detecting asymmetry. Only after first correcting the lower back, upper back and shoulder asymmetry, can these rather common and simple stretches be sufficient to correct most problems of the trapezius muscle. Spasm of the trapezius muscle was found to be commonly associated with recurrent neck pain on the same side. Unfortunately, the neck is very complex and easily injured. <u><b>Never exceed the mild discomfort intensity level</b></u>. If the Opti-stretch program does not significantly improve the recurrent neck strain problem, return to the physician who performed your pre-Opti-stretch physical, for re-evaluation.

<h3>17. SHOULDER HEIGHT AND A SYMMETRY</h3>
<p>
    Uneven shoulder height is very common in the general population and generally goes completely unnoticed. This
    condition can easily be detected by simply looking in the mirror and marking the top of each shoulder with a grease
    pencil. Then take a level and draw horizontal lines through each point. The difference in height can be measured
    with a ruler. More than a 1&frasl;2
    inch difference often means that something might be wrong with the hips, lower back or upper back.

    An extremely accurate measurement of shoulder rotation is the “Finger Touch” stretching exercise. With one hand
    placed behind the back and the other placed behind the head attempt to touch the fingers. If there is more than a
    1-inch difference from left to right, then measure how high up the back each hand will reach. Next measure how far
    down the back each hand will reach to determine where the tightness is in the shoulders. Frequently, I will hear the
    comment that “everybody has a difference”. This can easily be demonstrated not to be true in at least 20% of the
    population. However, there can be a 1-inch difference with excess activities using a dominant arm.

    The next common statement is; “Oh yeah, I broke that clavicle (or separated that shoulder) years ago”. Utilizing the
    Opti-stretch program, several of these individuals have not only been able to decrease the asymmetry in range of
    motion but also regain function that had been lost for decades. If there is any asymmetry of more than 1 inch,
    seriously consider the Opti-stretch program shoulder stretches. If you can’t come within 1 inch on the “Finger
    touch”, also seriously consider giving Opti-stretch a try. You might be pleasantly surprised. An A-C separation
    shoulder injury from long ago may return to essentially normal. To be able to skip a rock or throw a baseball again
    without pain is great.
