    <h3>1. KNEELING NOSE TO FLOOR – ERECTOR SPINAE STRETCH</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_023.png">

    <p>a. &nbsp;Wide stance kneeling position to start. Toes should be pointing straight back. Buttocks
        should be resting on the heels.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Fetal position curl. Attempt to place the chest gently to the knees. Attempt to place the forehead
        between the knees.</p>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a relaxing position to begin warming-up the low back. It can be eliminated if time is short. It
            allows detection of any injury to the erector spinae muscles.
        </li>
        <li>Those with neck problems should be extremely careful not to overflex the neck.</li>
        <li>This again should be a comfortable warm-up stretch. If you find it uncomfortable do not perform this
            stretch.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Risk factors:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> If unable to get the nose 4 inches above the knees, this suggests a possible limitation in normal range of
            motion for flexion of the spine.
        </li>
        <li>If unable to comfortably place the chest onto the knees suggests there may be some difficulty in performing
            the stretching exercise of “Sitting Nose to Knee” (Figure Four).
        </li>
