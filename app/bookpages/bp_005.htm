    Back pain is unquestionably a major problem. It is of epidemic proportions in all first world nations. Billions of
    dollars are spent annually. At its current rate, economists believe some nations with socialized medicine could
    become economically ruined. Moreover, in its more severe form, the pain and direct negative impact on individual
    human lives is enormous.
</p>

<p>
    This book deals only with one type of back pain due specifically to
    <u>muscle strain</u>. This accounts for approximately 85% of all back pain. The major focus is on low back strain
    that has reoccurred in precisely the same place more than twice.
</p>

<p>
    Theoretically, this type of back pain should be very straightforward. A muscle or muscles become strained and cause
    back pain. However, despite an exhaustive effort and millions of research dollars spent between 1960 to 1995, no
    specific muscle has been scientifically identified, which causes this type of back pain. Even in the 21st century,
    the precise cause of “Benign Back Pain” is referred to in the scientific literature as “enigmatic” (something hard
    to understand). During the 1990’s, lack of research dollars has stopped virtually all new research on back strain,
    except in Europe.
</p>

<p>
    The only known solution is stretching or exercise programs. Physical Therapy programs are the standard for the
    medical profession. During the exhaustive effort to research the problem, even Yoga was formally investigated. It
    was determined that it offered no additional significant benefit beyond that of Physical Therapy. Due to a large
    public outcry that Yoga did indeed work, it was again evaluated by the medical profession with the same conclusion.
    Since that time, literally hundreds of various stretching programs have been published. Most are well meaning
    individuals who honestly believe that they have found either a specific stretch or program that can help sufferers.
</p>

<p>
    So with all of the new and exciting scientific breakthroughs, what is the solution? Unfortunately, it is another
    stretching program. Believe me, I wished it had been a simple pill that we could take.
</p>

<p>
    The stretching exercises in this program do resemble those of other programs. However, the application is
    significantly different. By knowing precisely which muscle is injured, other muscles indirectly effected by this
    injury can be determined. Complex muscle adaptation patterns occur in the human spine that protect an acutely
    injured muscle and allow essential movements for the body. These muscles are far larger and more powerful, thus
    allowing subtle adaptations that have been difficult to clinically recognize in the past. Unless these accessory and
    antagonist muscles are targeted and rehabilitated, the primary injured muscle cannot be fully stretched in order to
    become
</p>

<p>
    completely rehabilitated. Therefore, the muscle heals to a suboptimal level. This muscle can remain in a pain free,
    asymptomatic, chronically injured state for decades. The muscle tightness and asymmetry goes completely
    unrecognized. In this state, the muscle is far more susceptible to reinjury. Thus, a vicious cycle of recurrent
    muscle strain is created. No other muscles of the human body or in the entire animal kingdom, for that matter, are
    like this. Therefore, medicine does not believe recurrent injury cycles exist (even though everyone with a bad back
    would disagree). The term “recurrent back pain” was coined to identify this syndrome. This knowledge helps to
    explain why some individuals have done amazingly well with certain stretching programs, while others have seen
    little benefit.
</p>

<p>
    The problem is made even more complex because it is not one muscle. Three separate muscles form the psoas muscle
    complex (pronounced so¯ ´as). Well documented anatomical variations in this muscle complex account for why some
    individuals never have any back pain. It also explains why some can rehabilitate a strained back after a few
    injuries, others keep reinjuring the same muscle and why others fall into a cycle of frequent reinjury (bad back),
    which can be both frustrating and incapacitating.
</p>

<p>
    The
    <u>major breakthrough</u>
    is that even after several decades and thousands of reinjuries, the psoas muscle complex can be rehabilitated. This
    happened to me. I was able to resume virtually any physical activity. My back has become healthy and strain
    resistant going on 6 years now, despite 23 years of recurrent back pain and 7 full years of very frequent
    reoccurrences. Others completing the program have had similar success.
</p>

<p>
    The second major breakthrough is the use of stretching exercises as a screening test. Certain patterns of muscle
    tightness can suggest a problem. Unless corrected, there is a higher risk that acute back strain can reoccur.
    Certain risk factors can even be recognized in childhood and corrected (see the chapter on Dr. Mom).
</p>

<p>
    This knowledge base led to other important discoveries. Muscle tone, an important but rather nebulous concept, can
    now be measured scientifically. This allowed the identification of a large group of individuals, who genetically
    have excess muscle tone. It has long been known that many hyperflexible individuals have as much or even more back
    pain than the general population. Recognition and improved theories as to how this can occur are presented.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch program is both very specific and goal oriented. Individuals with a “bad back” can <strong><em>finally
    see their problem</em></strong> . Asymmetry risk factors can be measured and
    <u>recorded</u>. Over time,
    <u>measured progress</u>
    can be documented. If stretch receptor lengthening is not gradually occurring, either the program is not being
    correctly performed, or other anatomical factors exist. There is a
    <u>completion point</u>
    where the individual moves on to strengthening and conditioning the muscles, so they are optimally healthy. There
    also is a
    <u>maintenance program</u>.
</p>

<p>
    Risk factor evaluation, therapeutic correction and life-long maintenance are the three steps of the Opti-stretch
    Challenge. Hundreds have been pleased with their results. Even one to two inches of stretch receptor lengthening
    have allowed significant increases in back health and activity levels.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately for me, the maintenance program does not require daily stretching exercises for the rest of my life, if
    I don’t want to. By understanding alternative ways of warming up the muscles and using favorite activities to
    maintain muscle health, the maintenance program is used on a periodic basis to assess muscle health. With more and
    varied activities, the stretching exercises are needed less frequently, usually at least once a week. In this way,
    Opti-stretch becomes a six month rehabilitation program so stretching on a daily basis is an option and not a
    life-long requirement.
</p>

<p>
    The knowledge gained during the program allows recognition of minor injuries in muscles and a good approach on how
    to rehabilitate them. This can be a valuable first aid tool for maintaining muscle health, especially as one ages.
</p>

<p>
    Due to my background in comparative vertebrate anatomy and medical training in several fields dealing with back
    pain, the second half of the book presents more scientifically the reasons why the program works. The Appendix has
    very important information and work-sheets that need to be looked at (except for section B). This scientific
    knowledge has finally put a dent in the complex battle of “recurrent back pain”, which has negatively plagued and
    perplexed man since earliest recorded history.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch program has been presented to nearly 50 physicians, two major medical societies and two major
    medical universities. To date, no-one has been able to demonstrate any flaws in the logic of the anatomy and
    physiology presented. Many have even become very excited, but realize that it would take over $3 million just to
    repeat this work for medical publication. Unfortunately, in the USA, research funds for this medical problem are
    currently no longer available.
</p>

<p>
    So, after 6 years of testing the long-term effects of the stretching exercises and techniques implemented, the
    program appears to be both
    <u>effective</u>
    and
    <u>safe</u>
    (as-long-as all of the recommendations are carefully followed). I sincerely hope it will prove as helpful to you as
    it has been for others and myself.
