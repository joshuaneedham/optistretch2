    <h3>SITTING CHEERLEADER <span style="font-size:80%">(CONTINUED)</span></h3>

    <p>a. &nbsp;The cheerleader pose is in the sitting position with the right leg bent at a 90 degree angle and the
        left leg bent outwards with extension backwards. There are 3 separate stretching exercises, which are performed
        on both the left and right sides.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;The “Nose to Knee” exercise is to slowly attempt to touch the nose to the left knee. The stretch is felt
        in the left front area of the thigh near the left hip. Measure the distance.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;The “Elbow to Ankle” exercise is to place the hands behind the head and slowly attempt to touch the left
        elbow to the left ankle. This allows determination of the general plane of motion. Measure the distance between
        the elbow and ankle.</p>

    <p>d. &nbsp;With the right hand on the right knee and the left hand on the left calf, attempt to touch the left
        ankle with the forearm. The stretch is felt in the left hip and lateral thigh. This position is used as the
        stretching exercise.</p>

    <p>e. &nbsp;The “Hip to Cross Knee” exercise is started with the left hand grabbing the left ankle. The right hand
        is on the right knee.</p>

    <p>f. &nbsp;Slowly attempt to bring the left hip forward and toward the right knee while holding the left ankle. The
        stretch is felt in the left groin area. For balance, the right hand can be placed on the floor.<br></p>

    <p>Notes: Frequently the stretch is felt in the inner aspect of the left knee in both the “Elbow to Ankle” and the
        “Nose to Knee” exercise stretches. Care should be taken not to overly stretch the knee area.<br></p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Frequently, it is even difficult to sit maintaining normal balance on one side versus the other in the
            normal cheerleader pose. This is a risk factor for the tighter side.
        </li>
        <li>In either the “Elbow to Ankle” or the “Nose to Knee” exercise stretches, if the stretch exceeds 1 inch on
            the left side compared with the right side, the tighter side is considered to have a risk factor.
        </li>
        <li>In the “Hip to Cross Knee” stretching exercise, if any sensation of extra tightness compared with the other
            side is found, this again is a risk factor for the tighter groin area.
        </li>
    </ol>
