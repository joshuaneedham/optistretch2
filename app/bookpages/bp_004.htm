    Bang…bang, slosh, you know perfectly well the washing machine is going to stop. The clothes have managed again…to
    clump on one side, and the drum bumps to a stop. Neither…mechanical machines nor the human body works well out of
    balance.
</p>

<p>
    I have taught classes with Dr. Neil for about 2 years through the continuing education program and have seen his
    theories proven, over and over again with every student we’ve seen who complains of back pain. Those with back pain
    always have more limited range of motion on one side of their bodies compared to the other.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes our students bring friends to the classes for moral support. These students not complaining of back pain
    have equal range of motion. Sometimes they’re very inflexible but still symmetrical, and the difference between the
    two groups of students show how tight and tender muscles can really cause debilitating pain.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch screening exercises detect the weak link in the muscle and the Optistretch therapeutic program
    teaches how to return the injured muscles to an elastic healthy state.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch challenge was designed to help students know what condition their muscles are in. It takes you from
    start to finish in rehabilitating a Chronically Injured Muscle.
</p>

<p>
    The last thing you want to do is hurt the muscles when you think you’re protecting them. Over-stretching can cause
    micro-tears and make the muscles more susceptible to injury and reinjury. It is important to understand how the
    intensity of stretch affects muscle health.
</p>

<p>
    I have heard students say…“Thank you, thank you, you’re an answer to my prayers”. In our last class a student said,
    “I don’t know why, but Opti-Stretch has really improved my belly-dancing”.
</p>

<p>
    The side-effects of Opti-Stretch are just about as rewarding as correcting “Asymptomatic Chronically Injured Muscles
    (ACIMs). Said plainly…“You just move better”. The improvement in agility and posture are easily noticed. I have seen
    remarkable improvement in the way people move in just a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
    In any sport, it’s important to have the core muscles aligned and balanced, just like a washing machine. You run
    better and more efficiently when you’re balanced and the joints suffer less stress.
</p>

<p>
    Of all the exercises out there, how do you know which ones are the best? Dr. Neil has done the research and picked
    out 20 of the best exercises. He also had to develop a few that would best tone the core muscles of the lower back,
    upper back and neck muscles.
</p>

<p>
    I didn’t start Opti-Stretch because of a bad back. My neck was killing me from whiplashes incurred while
    ice-skating. Dr. Neil had me start with the back exercises, then the shoulder exercises. After that, the neck was
    easy to rehabilitate. It was exciting to see my movement on the ice improve, too. You’ll see how differently the
    body works when the core muscles are symmetrical.
</p>

<p>
    Enjoy…You can use this program for a lifetime. If for some reason you sustain a muscle injury, you’ll know…when and
    how to rebalance and tone the muscles to their previous level of stretch. Opti-Stretch teaches…muscle management for
    a healthy back.
</p>

<p>
    I still stretch the Opti-Stretch way everyday and absolutely love the program. As long as I’m stretching, why not
    take advantage of knowing which stretches tone the big core muscles. Even though I’m 51, have 8 kids, and
    overweight, I still enjoy quite an active lifestyle. And I give Opti-stretch a lot of credit for that!
</p>

<p>
    Now… Dr. Neil needs to develop a weight loss program that works with such dramatic results.
