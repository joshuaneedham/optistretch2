    <p>a. &nbsp;In the sitting position bring the soles of the feet together. Grasp the ankles and rest the elbows on
        the thighs close to the knees.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;This is the level which many excellent male athletes can obtain.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;Exert pressure on the thighs by using the elbows. Slowly push the legs flat on the floor if possible.
        For this position, this is an anatomically delineated stretch (you can only go so far before the floor stops
        you). If unable to obtain this position measure as in figure (b).</p>

    <p>d. &nbsp;Next, exert pressure on the left thigh with the left elbow until the leg is flat on the floor. With the
        right hand on the right knee gently stretch the groin area. In some individuals, a definite difference in the
        sensation of the stretch is felt for different legs. While in this position, measure the height of the knee off
        the floor for each leg.</p>

    <p>e. &nbsp;In most children this is a very comfortable stretch. In many athletic adult males while even using the
        force of the elbows, the knees are usually 2 1&frasl;2 inches off the floor.</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is an important stretch for several reasons. First, it can be accurately measured. Second, these groin
            muscles are very sensitive to being overstretched. Comparison with the (Figure Four) stretch for stretching
            the hamstring muscles will allow the individual to learn how various muscles groups respond differently to
            various amounts of force that are placed on them.
        </li>
        <li>Knees should be at least 4 inches from the floor before proceeding on to the other Intermediate stretches.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> As seen in figure (4-b), if the knees cannot be brought within 21/2 inches of the floor, this
            is a risk factor for back pain.
        </li>
        <li>As seen in figure (4-b), this is a simple way to measure progress in this exercise, if the
            range of motion of both legs is similar.
        </li>
        <li>As seen in figure (4-c), if one groin stretches only to a definite firm stopping point while
            the other groin shows a more progressive gradual stretching process, this is considered a
            risk factor for back pain and often an indication of psoas tendon shortening.
        </li>
        <li>As seen in figure (4-d), if the difference between knees is measured to be more than 1
            inch further off the floor, this is considered a risk factor for back pain on that side.
        </li>
        <li>As seen in figure (4-d), if the individual is unable to comfortably place one leg on the
            floor and maintain balance in this position, this is also considered a risk factor.
        </li>
    </ol>
