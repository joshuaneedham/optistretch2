    The next exciting body of data was generated with a near relative named Blake. Blake was the all-state offensive
    tackle for his High School championship team. At 6 ft. 2 inches, he also played varsity basketball. He was an
    excellent all around athlete. During his senior year, I had measured his leg length to measure angular movement of
    the ankle in an athlete. His leg length measurement showed a
    1&frasl;4 inch shortening of the left leg with otherwise excellent body symmetry and range of motion.

	    He was still uncomfortable when walking. The significant difference in movement when transferring weight from one
	    leg to the other could easily be seen on videotape.
	</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Upon weight transfer to the right leg, the upper body is shifted further over the leg. There is an angulation and
	    slight rotation of the left side of the pelvis toward the front (anterior). Although not easily apparent, there is
	    approximately a 3&frasl;4 inch lowering of the right pelvis suggesting a functional shortening of the right leg.</li>
	    <li>While standing on the left foot, there is less shift of the weight at the knee over the foot. There is also less
    shift to the left of the upper body.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
    Note the symmetrical circles at the knees. When the weight is transferred to the right leg, the body automatically
    compensates for the 3&frasl;4 inch shortening of the right leg. The body is able to compensate without the person
    even being aware of the difference.

    Two months later he sustained a severe snowboard accident, where he fell striking his lower back area. The pain was
    severe and located over the right lower sacroiliac joint.
</p>
<p>
    Back x-rays were normal at the Emergency Room and he was diagnosed with a muscle strain. On returning home, the left
    leg was measured. Instead of being 1&frasl;4
    inch shorter than the right leg, it was now 3&frasl;4
    inch longer than the right leg. Also, there was marked tenderness of the psoas, iliacus and iliopsoas muscles. Leg
    length measurements were performed every other day. The leg length difference stayed the same during six separate
    measurements. After two weeks, the pain started to subside to the point where Blake could walk standing straight up
    and without a limp. His leg length in a two-day period had changed from right leg being shorter by
    3&frasl;4
    inches to his pre-injury condition where the left leg was
    1&frasl;4
    inch shorter. This suggests during pain and spasm of the psoas muscle complex, one leg can become shortened by as
    much as one inch.
