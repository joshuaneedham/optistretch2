    <h2>EXPLANATION OF THE SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</h2>

    <div class="hrwrap">■ ■ ■</div>
</div>
<p>This is the relatively simple part of the book.</p>

<p>
    One of the most important discoveries of Opti-stretch was the screening tests. In my dealing with recurrent back
    strain, the problem never made sense from a physiologic standpoint. For the first 10 years the problem was rather
    straightforward. Sometimes, for 2 to 5 year periods, I could do just about anything most guys my age could do. My
    back seemed pretty normal until for some reason, it would become reinjured, most commonly by overexertion while
    lifting.
</p>

<p>
    Various exercise and stretching routines seemed to work quite well and maintained the back in a healthy state for
    rather long periods of time. However, after age thirty, these same routines became much less effective and the
    length of time between reinjuries became much shorter. I was always trying new and improved exercise routines in
    order to rehabilitate my back injuries. They would definitely help heal the acute injury and help me to regain
    strength, but only to a certain level. Any exertion, beyond that level, would reinjure my back. After my fourth
    <u>severe</u> strain at age 38, there were seldom 3 months without some type of reinjury. Some of my patients with
    the diagnosis of “chronic back pain” had better activity levels than I did.
</p>

<p>
    The development of screening exercises, as a result of the Opti-stretch research, was tremendously exciting. For the
    first time, I could actually see and measure
    <strong><em>something</em></strong> that was different between myself and those with “never any back pain”. Research
    was then directed at correcting these measurable problems. Once I was able to correct the problem, I was then able
    to strengthen and condition the muscles to levels consistent with the above average individuals in my age group.
    There has been only one minor reinjury to that area of the back (which had plagued me for 23 years) during the past
    six years. Incidentally, the injury occurred not while lifting over 1 1&frasl;2 times my body weight but while
    evaluating a new stretching technique.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch has shown that <u>certain core muscles</u> can clinically exist in a partially healed state for
    decades. More importantly, even after decades of reinjury, this “weak link” muscle can be nearly 100% or more
    rehabilitated. In the scientific literature, muscle tissue usually heals in a predictable way. Following injury,
    most muscles heal in that area of damage to 110%. Severe damage is healed by scar tissue formation. Therefore, this
    healed area is actually more resistant to strain than other areas of the muscle. A new severe stress delivered to
    the muscle will cause injury to other areas of the muscle rather than the area that has been healed by scar tissue
    formation.
</p>

<p>
    Unless specifically tested for, the average individual does not realize that these certain core muscles have not
    completely healed and exist in this asymptomatic chronically injured muscle state (ACIM). These muscles are
    essentially asymptomatic and appear to be completely healed but they are not. These asymptomatic chronically injured
    muscles (ACIMs) possess the following four characteristics (<strong><em>the 4-T’s</em></strong>): <u>tight</u>, <u>tender</u>,
    <u>trigger</u> points and a shortened stretch to pain <u>transition</u>. A classic presentation is that an ACIM of
    the right side of the body will be noticeably tighter than the left side. This asymmetry or unequal movement is easy
    to detect using the stretching exercises. Over 350 different stretches from multiple sources were carefully reviewed
    and tested. Only those that were most effective at demonstrating the largest amount of asymmetry for a given
    specific core muscle (i.e., psoas for the low back and rhomboids for the upper back) were chosen. Several new
    stretches were designed to accomplish these goals.
</p>

<p>
    These tight muscles (ACIMs) contribute to asymmetry and constitute one of the most striking differences between the
    recurrent back strain groups and the
    <u>never had any</u>
    <u>back pain</u>
    group. The ACIM muscle is tighter because it is in a mild partially contracted state. This tight muscle will fatigue
    faster, making it more susceptible to reinjury. The reinjury process then keeps repeating itself given any extremes
    of activity. The occurrence of this condition represents a major risk factor in the development of the “recurrent
    back strain syndrome”.
</p>

<p>
    Asymmetry of certain core muscles is extremely common in the general population. Many individuals, upon seeing this
    difference in themselves will say, “everybody is a little different one side compared to the other”. This isn’t
    true. Approximately one in every five individuals will have perfect symmetry. However, it is true that the vast
    majority of over 60 to 80% will have minor differences of less than one inch. Much of this has to do with activities
    where a dominant arm or leg is consistently utilized. A classic example is a professional baseball pitcher who will
    have increased range of motion and strength in the pitching arm.
</p>

<p>
    A very important discovery was the demonstration that range of motion asymmetry can exist in the
    <u>never any back pain</u>
    group, as long as it is usually less than an inch. Also of note, these individuals were each able to comfortably
    perform the Standing Squat exercise (exercise #3, Advanced Program for Children and Fit Athletes).
</p>

<p>
    However, in the recurrent back strain group, the difference in stretched range of motion is usually greater than an
    inch. Sometimes a difference of 6 to 8 inches can be measured. It may sound difficult to believe that a full 2-inch
    difference in range of motion between the left and right side of the body can go completely unnoticed, let alone an
    8-inch difference. However, this degree of range of motion is only used by the body in a limited number of extreme
    activity levels. When used, it is generally associated with motion of the body. Regarding the core muscles of the
    body, other joints of the back and extremities can usually be easily recruited to achieve the needed range of
    motion. Opti-stretch stretching exercises were specifically designed to fix joints in one certainposition to prevent
    this recruitment of other joints. This allows for accurate measurement and assessment of the phenomenon of unequal
    movement. This is only one of several important reasons why the stretching exercise must be performed as directed.
</p>

<p>
    Like many screening tests in medicine, a positive test suggests there
    <u>may</u>
    be a problem, but it doesn’t necessarily tell you what is causing the problem. Asymmetry can exist due to extensive
    use of a dominant limb. While this is usually considered “normal” it can be a factor for injury in the non-dominant
    limb if certain activities are performed.
</p>

<p>
    There are several
    <strong></em>causes of muscle tightening and spasm</em></strong>
    on one side. Muscles of the body have 2 completely opposite functions. The first is to contract and move the
    skeletal structures of the body. The second is to spasm and prevent movement of the musculo-skeletal system in order
    to allow healing. A partially spasmed muscle (“PSM”) or completely spasmed muscle indicates that some type of
    pathology is causing the muscle to spasm and go into this protective role. It is characterized by an immediate
    detoning process of the muscle.
</p>

<p>
    The most common cause of a partially spasmed muscle (“PSM”) is due to acute injury to the muscle. Another very
    common cause is due to the formation of an asymptomatic chronically injured muscle (ACIM). The ACIM forms due to a
    direct strain injury to the muscle tissue itself. However, the healing process has halted for some reason prior to
    the muscle regaining its optimum health. The second most common problem is tendon shortening of a muscle (i.e.,
    iliopsoas muscle). By optimally toning of the muscle through the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Program or any other
    program that improves the muscle tone, allows for further strengthening and conditioning of that muscle. When
    optimum toning, strengthening and conditioning has occurred, even the complex problem of iliopsoas tendon shortening
    can be over 90% resolved. Unfortunately, there is no known effective way to completely lengthen a tendon, once it
    has become shortened.
</p>

<p>
    Acute and chronic injuries to joints, ligaments, bone, other tissue, and even an ACIM itself can also cause partial
    protective spasm of different muscles leading to asymmetry. (This is one reason why other muscles with partial
    protective spasm must be toned first, before the primary ACIM muscle can be rehabilitated.) These multiple indirect
    causes lead to the formation of a partially spasmed muscle, which have many of the characteristics of an ACIM
    muscle. This type of indirect spasm (injury) to muscles falls into the category of
    <strong></em>pathologic (malignant) back pain</em></strong>. There is no way to clinically differentiate between an
    indirect partial spasm and a direct partial spasm (ACIM). However, with the Opti-stretch therapeutic programs, there
    is a marked difference in these two types of muscle in how they respond to the program. The indirect partially
    spasmed muscle usually improves somewhat but often is not totally rehabilitated. In contrast, an ACIM will respond
    very favorably with a
    <u>complete healing</u>
    of the partially spasmed muscle.
</p>

<p>
    Both, an ACIM and other types of partially spasmed muscles (“PSMs”) can be present simultaneously in the same
    muscle. This is the primary reason why rehabilitation of
</p>

<p>
    an ACIM, over age 55 to 60, is so difficult. If a common condition such as arthritis of the joint is present, this
    makes rehabilitation of an ACIM much more difficult and generally less complete. With these types of
    <u>pathologic problems</u>, sometimes only a 10 to 20% improvement can be realistically expected. The good news is
    that even the small amount of improvement can markedly improve an individuals’ activity level and quality of life.
    In working with many individuals over the age of 55, complete toning of the muscles has been extremely difficult due
    to joint arthritis, normal aging processes of the muscle and other chronic conditions. This is a good reason for
    individuals to learn Opti-stretch before the age of 35 and definitely before age 50, if at all possible.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch therapeutic program was specifically designed for ACIMs. If this very specific condition exists,
    quite spectacular results can occur. However, many are finding noticeable benefit depending on the pathological
    cause of the “PSMs” such as certain types of herniated discs. The goal of Opti-stretch is to return muscle tone and
    help correct asymmetry. Even small improvements in muscle tone can decrease this imbalance and improve the health of
    various core muscle groups.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the importance of demonstrating unequal or asymmetric movement between the left and the right side of
    the body, there is a certain minimum range of motion needed by the core muscles in order to safely lift heavy
    objects. By being able to distribute the lifting force equally throughout the legs and back, helps protect the
    commonly injured area of the psoas muscle. This concept is much more complex and needs to be tailored to the
    individual body type. These genetically-controlled, body type factors (“BTFs”) such as height, gender, frame size,
    muscle mass, and morphism have to be taken into consideration. It requires a good working knowledge of anatomy and
    physiology. Again, the “Standing Squat” exercise was extremely helpful in determining minimal range of motion for
    certain core muscles of the back and helping to differentiate asymmetry which can be due to excess use of a dominant
    limb. If you have to grab the object to bring yourself down to the proper straight-back lifting position, an
    additional 20 to 30 pounds of force are placed on the psoas complex.
</p>

<p>
    Asymmetry of range of motion can easily be determined by the average individual by simply performing the screening
    tests and measuring the results. For a more complete evaluation, an instructor in Opti-stretch with more extensive
    anatomy and physiology knowledge is necessary. The screening diagnostic tests are designed for anyone who is
    healthy. Those who are over age 40 should have permission from their doctor, before even starting the screening
    tests. This helps to insure adequate health, so that no untoward event will occur.
</p>

<h3>THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE A HEALTHY BACK.</h3>

<p>
    The screening diagnostic tests document not only if the body moves symmetrically, but also gives an accurate and
    reproducible measurement of the stretched range of motion of the joints and muscles. Should an accident occur such
    as a car wreck or bad fall, recovery of this stretched range of motion is extremely important for
    <u>complete recovery</u>
    or maximum expected recovery. This knowledge can be invaluable in knowing when the individual has completely
    recovered the preexisting muscle tone and can safely go on to full strengthening and conditioning of the muscles.
    Also, loss of this stretched range of motion is a major factor in the aging process. There are multiple reasons for
    this process. However, the longer an individual can maintain this optimum range of motion, generally the more
    activities they can participate in, and the younger they will feel.
</p>

<h3>CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>
    This is for the Dr. Mom’s. Opti-stretch research shows over 95% of all healthy 3 to 5 year olds who are close to
    ideal body weight can perform the Advanced Program for Children and Fit Athletes. Moreover, this absolute stretched
    range of motion is extremely uniform for all individuals in this age group regardless of the body type factors
    (“BTFs”). Opti-stretch has determined this range of motion to be a “gold standard”. Range of motion beyond this
    level can be helpful for special activities (i.e., gymnastics and martial arts). However, excess range of motion
    beyond the “gold standard” does not appear to significantly help in rehabilitating a “bad back” or in preserving a
    healthy back throughout life.
</p>

<p>
    Once documented at this age, every 6 months or yearly the screening test should be repeated to assure there is no
    change. If there is a change due to a developing specific body type, the decrease in range of motion should be
    completely symmetrical. Opti-stretch research suggests that many of the initial injuries actually occur in
    childhood, which then later predispose the individual to recurrent back strain in puberty and early adulthood.
</p>

<p>
    By age 6, gender difference and the 12 to 20% of the population with hyperflexibility start to be clinically
    manifested. It has been known for hundreds of years that individuals with hyperflexibility have at least the same or
    even a higher incidence of back pain. That is the reason why certain levels of flexibility have never been promoted
    in modern medicine beyond what is concluded to be the “ normal voluntary range of motion” as measured by most
    physicians. “Stretched range of motion”, in the past, has been far too variable, problematic, and time consuming to
    be clinically useful except in certain limb and shoulder injuries. Remember, absolute range of motion is not the
    key.
</p>

<p>
    Asymmetry is the key to look for. Even then, certain small amounts of asymmetry are considered to be normal in
    certain individuals. The Intermediate Screening Tests will accurately detect the majority of important core-muscle
    asymmetry problems, even in the hyperflexible or double-jointed individuals.
</p>

<p>
    Another valuable use of this knowledge is determining when an adolescent can return to full activity. Almost every
    kid crashes a bicycle or gets banged up. Frequently, some kids will reinjure themselves if allowed to return to full
    activity too soon. If they are comfortably able to perform the Advanced Program, there is less chance of reinjury
    when returning to full activity. By comparing to previous test measurement, this will help Dr. Mom to evaluate
    whether any residual muscular injury of a core muscle has occurred.
</p>

<h3>MEASURING AND DETECTING ACIMS. (NOW IT’S TIME TO GET STARTED)</h3>

<p>
    Little is needed to get started. You’ll need this book and a ruler or tape measure. Then, find a comfortable carpet
    or exercise mat. Consider this book as a workbook that should be written in. If you are one of the many that just
    can’t bring themselves to write in books, you will need some paper and a pencil.
</p>

<p>
    Certain very important concepts are necessary to understand in order to prevent injury. Most important is that you
    <strong><em>must not over-stretch</em></strong>! Stretched range of motion is nothing more than applying a certain
    force to the muscles which possess viscoelastic properties. The amount of force is referred to as the intensity of
    stretch. However, if the force is applied too rapidly, in a jerking fashion or with too much intensity, stretch
    receptors within muscles, joints and tendons will detect this as a noxious (injurious) stimulus. Muscles then
    reflexively contract to protect the body from injury. When this happens, even more stress is placed on certain
    muscle tissues, which can increase the chance of injury.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch research has demonstrated that the majority of individuals over-stretch. This is especially common in
    children and adolescents. Most adults have not tried to stretch their muscles since they were an adolescent and
    participating in sports. The above mentioned groups will just force the muscle until it hurts. Past the age of 35
    and if asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMs) are present, this over-stretching significantly increases
    the chance of injury. Even micro-injury can predispose a young athlete to a more serious strain during a game.
    Incidentally, individuals that overstretch do not like to perform stretching exercises and are less likely to do so
    when older.
</p>

<p>
    Most books dealing with stretching recommend gently increasing the stretch until the individual feels moderate
    discomfort. With the screening test, an individual can choose either a mild or moderate intensity of stretch. The
    specific point between mild and moderate is usually the safest. (Note that it is extremely important not to bounce).
    It is also very important that the same intensity of stretch is used for both sides of the body. This is especially
    true if a mild intensity of stretch is performed. A mild intensity of stretch on one side and a moderate intensity
    of stretch on the other side will narrow the differences and decrease the accuracy while measuring stretched range
    of motion. The stretch must be held comfortably for at least 5 to 10 seconds and then measured.
</p>

<p>
    Stretched range of motion involves determining how far the relaxed muscle will allow a joint to move in a given
    plane of motion. Normal, non-stretched range of motion is determined by how far an individual can move a joint by
    either voluntarily contracting or relaxing certain muscles. In clinical medicine, this is measured with a goniometer
    in degrees of joint movement. An indirect way to measure stretched range of motion is both easier and more accurate
    for most individuals. Opti-stretch screening tests use the distance between 2 determined anatomical points to
    measure range of motion (say touching the nose to the knee). It is very easy to determine and remember when your
    nose was 3 inches away from your knee, compared to now being only 1 inch away. Likewise, it is easy to determine
    even small amounts of progress. Measurement with a goniometer is complex and time consuming. A great deal of normal
    anatomy has to be understood before the results are both accurate and reproducible. (Unfortunately, this type of
    2-point measurement of Opti-stretch does lead to problems both in comparing different individuals and to be able to
    scientifically publish data. In my opinion, the simplicity and value to the individual who wants to accomplish
    certain Opti-stretch goals is well worth it.)
</p>

<p>
    The next most common cause of injury is that our minds are goal oriented. A very common problem is to say “I can put
    my nose on my knee” or “with a little effort, I can do that”. Through a number of complex mechanisms, the brain will
    attempt to help you achieve this goal. Unfortunately, this can often lead to muscle strain (especially in a poorly
    toned muscle). To avoid injury due to focusing on a distance, shut your eyes after detecting the “first sensation of
    stretch” (see below) and focus entirely on what sensations the stretch receptors are telling you. Many prefer just
    partially closing the eyes so that the distant point is somewhat obscured.
    <strong><em>Never decide in advance or actively focus on what point you want to achieve!</em></strong> Focus only on
    the information that the stretch receptors of your body are indicating as to the intensity of the stretch.
</p>

<p>
    Everyone is different in their own opinion of what is mild discomfort and when it becomes moderate discomfort. For
    example, the sensation of moderate discomfort for an 8-year-old boy and a 28-year-old NFL football player are not
    even remotely the same. In future chapters, you will learn how to determine accurately these levels for yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Also, there are “extreme individuals” who push any activity to its most extreme level. Therefore, a maximum
    intensity of force that one can deliver to a muscle and still avoid injury is discussed later. Once you can learn
    and interpret the different sensations produced by your various stretch receptors (i.e., muscle, tendon and
    ligament), you will learn first hand how complex the muscular organ system of the body really is. You can then
    appreciate the impact fatigue, anxiety, stress, illness and various cyclical changes can have on the muscles in the
    body. This knowledge is referred to as the first aid part of the Opti-stretch program.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the stretching exercises in this book show two positions, the “start of the stretch” and the “gold standard”
    level of stretch. The start of the stretch demonstrates where most average individuals will feel the “first
    sensation of stretch”. The “first sensation of stretch” is a very important concept in Opti-stretch research. Any
    movement, prior to this position should produce no sensation of stretching in any muscle group. Also, a trained
    professional can objectively detect this precise point in an individual, by feeling the change in resistance of
    muscles as the individual approaches this point. This is very exciting for several reasons. First, many large groups
    of individuals will have nearly the identical point as their “first sensation of stretch”. From a scientific
    standpoint, it is important to know that a professional can detect very precisely this point for research purposes.
    In the past, electronic sensors were placed on the muscle. Unfortunately for several muscles, like the psoas muscle,
    the location of these deep core muscles in the body does not allow for placement of electronic sensors and other
    experimental probes.
</p>

<p>
    Next, in normal and healthy individuals without any acute injuries, this point is very symmetrical when comparing
    the left and right sides of the body. Even individuals who have tight ACIMs up to 8 inches will still have normal
    symmetry for their “first sensation of stretch” on both the left and right sides. However, with acute injury to the
    muscle, this point will be altered and occur sooner helping to differentiate chronic and acute injuries.
    Scientifically, this is very valuable information. Also, it is important knowledge for everyone. This knowledge can
    serve as important first aid information. Awareness of even mild acute injuries can allow individuals to adequately
    protect the muscle. Frequently, these mild injuries are reinjured and converted to a much more serious strain
    injury.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately due to space in the book, the second photo is usually the “gold standard”. This stretched range of
    motion, for the majority of people, appears quite extreme. It is very important to realize two things. Most adults
    with documented very healthy backs <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> achieve this “gold standard” range of motion.
    Also, individuals with very bad backs can easily achieve this level (if they are genetically hyperflexible).
    Unfortunately, for some individuals with a long history of ACIMs, they must achieve this level before the
    chronically injured muscle can become completely toned. The “gold standard” can then be considered a stopping point
    or accomplished goal. Achieving range of motion beyond this level does not appear to significantly help in the
    rehabilitation process of ACIMs.
</p>

<p>
    When measuring on the screening diagnostic tests, you can detect ACIMs even in the mild discomfort intensity level
    if you pay attention to only the stretch receptors. The screening tests should be performed at this level in older
    individuals and those with severe ACIMs to avoid strain injuries to these sensitive muscles. This program focuses on
    important core muscles that are seldom used daily and are the most easily injured with excessive activities. Because
    you are using highly leveraged stretches specifically on the core muscles that have chronic injuries, an acute
    injury can easily occur if you are not careful. In the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Programs, you will stay at the mild
    intensity of stretch for the first two months or until the muscles are toned to a level where they can tolerate,
    without injury, a higher intensity of stretch.
</p>

<p>
    After detecting the “first sensation of stretch”, which is the start of a mild discomfort sensation, slowly continue
    the stretch until a different sensation occurs. Stop, open your eyes and measure the distance between the two
    reference points. Most stretches are named according to these reference points making these points easy to remember
    (i.e., Sitting Nose to Knee). Next, record the distance (the easiest is in inches). A very common error is not to
    write this information down. Most people don’t want to record this level because they think their own level is just
    too bad to record. Others think, “I’ll just remember it”. (This is extremely difficult when the point has been
    gradually changing over 6 months.) This recorded information is extremely valuable, as previously mentioned, for the
    purpose of rehabilitation should a severe accident occur. Having worked in the field of Physical Therapy, many
    individuals are determined as being back to “average normal” range of motion when their own previous level of normal
    has not yet been obtained. This can lead to problems in the future.
</p>

<p>
    Recording the results can serve as an important reference point in your life and can be followed to see how you are
    progressing or at least staying the same. Each program should be measured 3 times so you can pick which set of
    numbers best represent your starting point. Remember, the normal adult aging process will continue to decrease the
    stretched range of motion. The longer you maintain this level (even if it is somewhat limited), the more activities
    you can participate in as you age. Your doctor may even consider you as “younger than stated age”.
</p>

<p>
    Everyone except children should start with the Beginning Program screening stretches. A good idea is to do this
    beginning screening test on different days for 3 days. Record your best results. Next proceed to the Intermediate
    Program. These are more complex stretches. (Many will feel they are past the “first sensation of stretch” just
    getting into the starting position of a particular stretching exercise. If you happen to be one of these
    individuals, stop and proceed to the upper back and neck screening exercises. Chances are high that you will benefit
    from the Opti-stretch Therapeutic Program which is presented later in this book.)
</p>

<p>
    Next, attempt the upper back and neck screening diagnostic stretches from the Intermediate Program and record your
    results. Remember that neck muscles are extremely fragile compared with the lower back muscles. Extra caution in
    attempting these screening diagnostic stretches is very important in order to avoid a strain.
</p>

<p>
    If able to successfully pass the Intermediate test to the “gold standard”, “children and fit athletes” can then
    proceed to the Advanced Program. An extra word of caution is necessary for the exercise called the “Standing Squat”.
    This stretch is comfortably and routinely performed by individuals in their 60’s and 70’s in many 3rd world nations.
    Prior to the 1980’s this stretch was routinely used in the medical profession to demonstrate subtle alterations in
    blood flow, which were useful in detecting certain right heart murmurs. If you cannot comfortably perform this
    stretch and then try to force yourself into this position, very significant alterations in blood flow can occur.
    Even a healthy individual can feel dizzy and even pass out. If you have certain abnormalities or disease processes,
    this can be extremely dangerous.
</p>

<p>
    Anyone over the age of 40 not only should have a physical exam by their physician. They should also have a qualified
    spotter (assistant) for the first couple of times. Remember that serious consequences can occur with any medical
    problems and especially those with cerebral aneurysm, high blood pressure, heart disease and deep vein thrombosis.
</p>

<p>
    The above guidelines are identical for the “Bridge” stretching exercise. They are designed for children ages 3 to 5
    because they can be fun for the children, while at the same time evaluating multiple joints and muscles which are
    important in lifting heavy objects and maintaining a healthy back. Because over 95% of children ages 3 to 5 can
    comfortably perform these advanced exercises, this serves as an excellent guideline of normalcy. In first world
    nations, the percentage of individuals who can comfortably perform these stretching exercises falls by 10-20% each
    decade. By age 50, this rate has fallen to a low percentage of the population. However, there are individuals over
    age 50 that can perform these advanced stretches to the level of the “gold standard”. All these individuals
    considered themselves to have very healthy backs. If these stretches can be comfortably performed throughout
    adolescence and adulthood, Opti-stretch research suggests this may be a good way to preserve the optimum function of
    the spine. The one possible exception is in the hyperflexible group of individuals. A chapter is dedicated to this
    group who are experiencing recurrent back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Asymmetry of more than 2 inches is frequently found in individuals with “recurrent back strain syndrome”. When the
    asymmetry is an inch or less, the chance of “recurrent strains” in a single location are diminished unless
    underlying pathology is present. Having had the opportunity to evaluate even world class athletes, few can perform
    all the stretches to the level of the “gold standard”. However, the majority can usually come within 3 to 5 inches
    of this level very comfortably.
</p>

<p>
    If you can comfortably pass all of the screening tests (Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced), you have successfully
    completed the major goals of the Opti-stretch Program. Thank Mother Nature, record your results and consider
    completing the Optistretch Therapeutic Program prior to age 30. It is helpful in understanding the optimum function
    of the muscles and serves as great first aid knowledge should an injury occur. After age 35, when muscles start
    changing due to the normal aging process, this knowledge will be extremely valuable. The only other recommendation
    is to find an enjoyable sport or activity to preserve this stretched range of motion for life.
</p>

    For those who have the symptoms of “recurrent back strains” or have asymmetry of the body of over an inch, this book
    is dedicated to you. My sincere wishes are that you may find this knowledge as beneficial as I did in helping me to
    stop the process of recurrent strains (a major problem in my low back and a less severe area in my upper back).
