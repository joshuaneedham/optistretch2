<h3>4. CHRONICALLY INJURED MUSCLES</h3>

<p>
    Core muscles of the body can remain in a state of partial spasm for long periods of time, such as years. This muscle
    state is referred to as a chronically injured muscle, when the individual has some indication of discomfort at rest
    or during an activity. In medicine, this is often seen in individuals who continually push a significantly injured
    muscle and not allow it to heal properly. Many individuals with significant injuries, due to some-
</p>

<p>
    thing like a car accident, have reported over a year to heal the muscle and another 3 to 4 years to get the muscle
    feeling back to essentially normal.
</p>

<p>
    The asymptomatic chronically injured muscle (ACIM) behaves exactly the same, except that the individual is
    completely unaware that there is a problem.
    <u>Four T’s</u>
    characterize this condition:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Tightness to stretch,</li>
	<li>Tenderness to touch,</li>
	<li>Trigger points (a name for knots in the muscle that are especially tender),</li>
	<li>Transition of stretch to pain is shortened.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    To the individual, the muscle is asymptomatic and usually seems to function about the same as it used to, prior to
    the injury. However, the muscle is
    <u>extremely susceptible to reinjury</u>
    and recurrent strains. These asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMs) are more noticeable in the upper back
    and neck muscles because the core muscles involved are quite superficial. Frequently, these muscles do not
    completely heal when treated by normal physical therapy treatment. In the 1960’s, Dr. Janet Travell, personal
    physician to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, first demonstrated that trigger points could be injected with various
    medications. This promoted healing in many individuals. However, in some individuals, the symptoms would simply
    resolve for two weeks and then return. Healing any type of chronically injured muscle still remains a difficult task
    in medicine.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch has demonstrated that asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMs), even without knots, exhibit
    some degree of tenderness. Often the muscle tenderness is so slight that it can only be detected by putting
    precisely the same amount of pressure simultaneously on the chronically injured muscle and the healthy muscle
    located on the other side of the body. The same exact force to each side of the body usually allows the individual
    to detect the slight increase in tenderness or tightness. Frequently, massage therapists will point out these tight
    and tender muscles to the individual. Many massage therapists will then encourage stretching exercises for the
    individual. Other types of “therapists” may recommend a myofascial release or more invasive type of therapy.
</p>

<p>
    The Opti-stretch screening stretches are designed specifically for the average individual to be able to confirm what
    their massage therapist has told them. They can detect these tight and tender muscles for themselves.
    Patho-physiologically, these muscles appear not to have undergone complete healing (cross webbing of the scar). This
    makes these muscles much more susceptible to injury.
</p>

<p>
    Once this extremely common problem is detected, many have devised their own way to tone, strengthen and condition
    the muscles. Once accomplished, this partially injured muscle appears to be no more susceptible to injury than any
    other muscle.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a good system that has helped everyone. Now with Opti-stretch, a good scientific
    system exists. It can document that the muscles are not completely healed. The “weak link” can be detected.
</p>

<p>
    The asymptomatic chronically injured muscle not only constitutes the major risk factor for recurrent back pain, but
    also is something that can be eliminated through using the Opti-stretch therapeutic programs. Specific screening
    stretches give a very “reproducible measurement” of the amount of muscle tightness. A measurable degree of tightness
    from one side of the body compared to the other side is referred to as an abnormality in
    <u>body symmetry</u>. Detection of differences in body symmetry, due to asymptomatic chronically injured muscles
    (ACIMs), is the major goal of the Opti-stretch screening program. There are several other causes of differences in
    body symmetry, such as shortening of bone, tendons and ligaments. These other causes are usually not correctable to
    the extent that the asymptomatic chronically injured muscle can be corrected.
