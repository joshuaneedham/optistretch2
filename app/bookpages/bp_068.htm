<h3>5. MUSCLE TONE</h3>

<p>
    Opti-stretch
    <u>therapeutic exercises</u>
    are designed to restore muscle tone. Several definitions of muscle tone exist. The definition used in this book is
    the definition used by the general population. Recently this concept has been popularized to represent a normal
    state of flexibility and general health of the muscle. It is a muscle with optimum elasticity and range of motion.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch data suggests the range of motion for an individual is highly dependent on several factors. Age,
    gender, height, frame size, “double-jointedness” and muscle tone are important determinants. Constructing a
    normogram for the first 5 factors allows a predicted average range of motion for a given body type. Variance from
    predicted flexibility for specific body types provides an indication of muscle tone. The key to this data is the
    accurate, reproducible and a relatively easy determination of range of motion. Stretching exercises allow for this
    type of measurement.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch defines muscle tone as the distance stretched from the “first sensation of stretch” to where some level
    of discomfort is felt (either mild, moderate, or moderately severe). The more toned the muscle, the more intensity
    of force can be applied. Also, a greater stretch distance is achieved before a given level of discomfort is reached
    (such as moderate discomfort). In toned muscles, the levels of mild, moderate, moderately-severe, and severe
    discomfort are easily recognized. Each has a specific range for a give muscle. Any foreshortening of this range is
    an indication that something is wrong with the muscle.
</p>

<p>
    Now, for the first time, an objective measurement of an individuals muscle tone can be performed accurately with
    only simple measuring devices (measuring tape and aneroid manometer). While large populations have not yet been
    studied, the accuracy of these parameters should allow certain comparisons between different size and type of muscles. Also, certain
    comparisons between specific body types may be available (see Graph 2, page 89). Of significant interest, both from
    a scientific and a clinical standpoint, is the early similarity and later differences for a poorly toned muscle
    (i.e., ACIM) and a healthy muscle. The early parts of both graphs are very similar for a measured small distance of
    stretch. The marked difference is in the later part of the graph. The healthy muscle will move relatively much
    further and withstand a much greater intensity of measured force in millimeters of mercury pressure. The healthy
    muscle usually has 4 discernible transition points from “stretch to pain”. The poorly toned muscle or an ACIM
    typically has only 2 or 3 transition points. A severe acutely injured muscle will usually have only 1 transition
    point, which is about 8 to 10 millimeters or less of mercury pressure. By using the above Opti-stretch principles,
    muscle tone can be more scientifically defined and in the future help identify realistic parameters.

<p>
    After the age of 35, accessory (secondary) stretch receptors can be demonstrated, before the muscle is warmed up.
    Once the muscle is warmed up, the individual will feel the primary stretch receptors of the muscles, just as the
    young do. They also can begin to feel the other stretch receptors in the musculo-skeletal system such as ligaments
    and tendons.
</p>

<p>
    Excessive tone in core muscles does exist. In those that engage in certain sports that require extensive range of
    motion, excessive tone can be developed (acquired or environmental). This rarely presents a problem. However, there
    is a fairly large percentage of the population (10 to 20%) who will demonstrate some aspect of double-jointedness.
    This is considered a congenital condition and conveys to the individual a certain amount of extensive tone dependent
    on the degree of double-jointedness. Often, these double-jointed individuals will demonstrate a significantly
    different pattern of back reinjury compared with those individuals who are not double-jointed. Optistretch theory
    believes that because of the excessive tone, the muscles do not adequately protect other skeletal structures, which
    can then lead to muscle, joint and ligament injury.
</p>

<p>
    Be aware that in the medical literature “tonus” or tone, when applied to muscles has a somewhat different and very
    specific scientific and medical definition. It generally applies to antigravity muscles. Both the lack of tone
    (hypotonicity) and too much tone (hypertonicity) of the muscles can be detected. Either of these two conditions can
    be associated with an increase in muscle strain.
