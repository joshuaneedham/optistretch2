	<h3>9. SECOND POSITION</h3>
	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_075.png"/>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>This is a common dance position. With the knees bent and the feet approximately shoulder width, rotate the feet
			so the toes are pointing 180 degrees from each other. Slowly tighten the quadriceps until the knees are straight.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Note:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This requires a great deal of strength of the gluteus medius muscle. Discomfort of one side of the back and upper
    pelvic area is a risk factor. Also rotation of the pelvis is considered to be a risk factor. Use the various muscles
    of the pelvis to try and prevent rotation.</li>
