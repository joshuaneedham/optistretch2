<div class="figure-example">
  <p>a. &nbsp;In the prone position, extend the left arm fully above the head and bring the left leg to a 90 degree
        position as if to crawl. As seen from the left.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Due to the complexity of the stretch, it is broken down into various steps. First start this complex
        exercise in the prone position by extending the left arm fully above the head.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;With the right arm in a push up position, push the right side of the body to a 45 degree roll.</p>

    <p>d. &nbsp;Return to neutral and bring the left leg to a 90 degree angle and slowly attempt the roll. This puts a
        tremendous amount of twisting motion to the low back.</p>

    <p>e-f. &nbsp;Measure the height of the left groin from the floor.</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the back is tight, this motion will cause the low back to pop. Sometimes up to 3 separate pops at 3
            levels of the low back can be both felt and heard. This popping sensation should disappear after the first 2
            weeks of exercise. If it does not disappear, this stretch should be discontinued. The goal is not to pop the
            back but to loosen the lumbar muscles so the back doesn’t pop.
        </li>
        <li>The stretch should be felt primarily in the mid-line of the low back just above the pelvis level.</li>
        <li>The stretch should also be felt in the groin area of the left side. Often the stretching sensation will feel
            the same. However, the distance the groin is to the floor can be significantly different. This distance can
            be measured in two different ways. First a level and tape measure can measure the height of the pelvis from
            the floor. A second way is to measure with the hand the height of the groin off the floor (see figure e. and
            f.).
        </li>
        <li>Although difficult to measure, it is important to determine if the height of pelvis off the floor is more
            than 1&frasl;2 inch higher than the other side. This measurement does not need to be repeated on a regular
            basis as it seldom changes significantly. This is presumed to be largely due to tendon shortening.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the fragility of these muscles do not exceed mild stretch or do only the warm up and avoid the
            Opti-stretch phase.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the height of the groin off the floor has more than a 1&frasl;2 inch different between sides, this is a
            very important risk factor to determine. In this situation, the muscles of the buttocks are first contracted
            in order to bring the groin of the bent leg as close to the floor as possible. Then a twisting motion of the
            low back is performed.
        </li>
        <li>If the low back continues to pop on a regular basis for over a month, the exercise should be discontinued.
            The rationale is that popping of joints over prolonged periods of time can lead to hypertrophy of the joint
            capsule in certain joints.
