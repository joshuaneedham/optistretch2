    the right shoulder height. This suggests that although the back had apparently healed, there is a high probability
    that some of the back muscles had not completely healed and had stayed in a chronic injury state. Shoulder height
    asymmetry such as this has frequently been observed for individuals suffering from “recurrent back pain syndromes”,
    especially associated with psoas injury.
</p>

<p>
    Two other examples were noted to support the concept of spasm of the psoas muscle and the diagnostic value of
    Opti-stretch. Both were females of about 17 years of age.

    They were cousins. They were both extremely athletic and both could easily complete all of the advanced Opti-stretch
    stretching exercises without difficulty and with full range of motion. Each would be considered very flexible. Dayna
    had a
    <span>1&frasl;4</span>
    inch shorting of her left leg. The right leg of Sasha also measured
    <span>1&frasl;4</span>
    inch shorter. Within a twoyear period of time both of them had sustained a moderate back strain. Each had
    approximately
    <span>1&frasl;4</span>
    inch further shortening of the respective legs at the time of the moderate back pain. Opti-stretch screening
    stretches showed a full two inch inability to complete the “Sitting Nose to Knee” – (Figure Four) on their
    respective shortened sides. Several other significant differences in body symmetry were found using the screening
    stretches. After resolution of the moderate back pain, the screening stretches were then repeated. The symmetrical
    range of motion had completely returned. Also, the leg length on the respective sides returned to
    <span>1&frasl;4</span>
    inch difference.

<p>
    Data from these three individuals suggests that, at least in certain individuals, shortening of one leg can occur
    with injury. This was associated with low back pain and psoas muscle complex tenderness. With healing of the back
    injury, the shortening returned to pre-injury length.
