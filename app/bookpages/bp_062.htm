    <h2>WALKING PROGRAM</h2>

<p>
    Don’t forget to include a walking program for cardiovascular fitness. A 20 minute a day program can be performed in
    5 minute intervals. The first 2 minutes should be a gentle warm-up walk. In 1 to 5 minute intervals, a brisk walk
    should be alternated with a lengthened stride walk. Pay careful attention with the lengthened stride walk to observe
    for any tightness in the groin area of one leg. Be careful not to overextend the stride too much and strain the
    groin area (iliopsoas). By gradually lengthening the stride, a significant portion of the psoas muscle on the
    affected side is both strengthened and conditioned.

<h3>PROGRESS CAREFULLY TO NEW ACTIVITY LEVELS</h3>
<p>
    The major goal of Opti-stretch is to return to your optimum activity level. It is imperative to have your
    cardiovascular system equally as healthy as your back. There is a very serious potential problem, which I’ve seen
    both in students and myself. Despite months or years of inactivity due to back pain, once the back feels great,
    there is a tendency to immediately return to a previous activity level and even try to press further. While your new
    back may tolerate this, other skeletal structures and your heart may not. For example, at age 45, I had not lifted
    anything heavier than 60 pounds for 7 years. After completing the Opti-stretch program, I went to the gym to test my
    new back out. It felt very exhilarating to be lift heavy objects again. Before long, I was up to 250 pounds before
    straining a left hamstring muscle. I didn’t even think about how much stress I was placing on my heart. This could
    have resulted in a more serious problem than just pulling a hamstring. Fortunately, I had been doing the walking
    program.

    Remember, it is important to work up to your new activity levels gradually and intelligently. This is particularly
    true if you are over age 35, or if it has been more than a month since you had to stop a certain activity level.

<p>
    Don’t forget your heart and cardiovascular system while working at the Opti-stretch program. If you get the same
    near miraculous results that others have, a good healthy heart will come in handy to keep up with your new back.
