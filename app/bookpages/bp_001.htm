    This book is dedicated to my daughter Angela. She gave me the inspiration and determination to push beyond the
    boundaries of medicine that I had been taught. This allowed me to pursue new and exciting levels of information.
</p>

<p>
    Without the help of my family members, Jack Neil, Paula Neil, Jay Neil, Terry Murray and Jerry Smith, this book
    could not have been written. They provided encouragement, sustenance, financial support and editing contributions.
    Their large families were essential in order to analyze various range of motion techniques, family tendencies and
    types of normal variations. They were also gracious enough to pose for some of the photographs.

<p>
    A special thanks to the thousands of patients who contributed their time in allowing me to ask extensive questions
    about their back pain experience. Without this type of first-hand information, many of the original theories could
    not have been derived. Those individuals who were in the 20% that never had experienced back pain provided
    invaluable insight and ideas as to optimum range of motion parameters. I am indebted to the large number of
    patients, friends, and relatives who were kind enough to try some of the stretching exercises and submit to this
    type of physical examination. Of special thanks to Blake Sampson, Jayson Neil, Dayna, Sasha, JeNeil, RaeLyn,
    Russell, Jamie, Codie, Candace, Logan and Dakota.

<p>
    Next I would like to thank the multitude of superb instructors starting from first grade throughout my 28 years of
    formal education. I would like to extend a special thanks to the instructors who helped teach me the skills and
    techniques of formal research.
</p>

<p>
    I would also like to thank Dr. William Brydon, Dr. Kevin Oyama, Jayson Neil, Paula Neil, and Terry Murray for their
    review and helpful ideas.
</p>

<p>
    While there were many unfortunate and significant set backs, I would like to thank both family and friends for their
    kindness and encouragement. Unfortunately, Optistretch may not have all the answers, but hopefully, formal
    scientific study will prove or disprove these new theories with larger populations. Significant breakthroughs in the
    relief of recurrent back pain are on the horizon for millions of individuals who battle against this problem.
</p>

<p>
    While Opti-stretch may not work for everyone, I am thoroughly convinced there are literally millions of individuals
    worldwide that can be helped with the information found in this book. I originally went into medicine to help
    people. It is my sincere hope that the information in this book will be as helpful to you as it has been and
    continues to be for me.
