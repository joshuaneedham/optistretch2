	<h3>5. KNEELING BACK BRIDGE - PSOAS COMPLEX MUSCLES</h3>
	<img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_069.png"/>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>In the kneeling position, place your hands on the back side of the ankles.</li>
		<li>Arch the back forward and upward. This places a significant stretch on the psoas muscles.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This does not put quite as much stretch on the psoas muscles as does the normal bridge position.</li>
		<li>For individuals with shoulder and wrist problems this is a preferable stretching exercise.</li>
		<li>Perform slowly and carefully. Still use an experienced spotter, as it is quite easy to lose your balance with
    this stretching exercise. This especially is true in the early learning phase.</li>
	</ol>
