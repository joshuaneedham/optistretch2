<h3>12. WARMING UP</h3>
<p>
    The muscles are maximally protected during the fight-or-flight response. In an emergency situation adrenaline is
    released. This chemical is known to provide maximum performance of the muscles while decreasing the chance of muscle
    injury. In nonemergency situations where adrenaline is not produced, a warm up is essential to prevent injury to
    muscles. This is especially important as one ages.
</p>

<p>
    Remember stretching routines are just one of many types of warm-up routines. Warmup routines vary significantly from
    sport to sport and from individual to individual. The most effective routine is one that works for the individual
    and is practiced on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
    Professional basketball players have a definite warm-up routine. It involves gradually increasing in intensity the
    movements that will be required at the opening tip off. First, there is a period of shooting the basketball with
    sweats on. When they feel completely warmed up, the sweats come off and a few complex moves are tried before the
    start of the game. (Note that when the player is warming up an injured leg or ankle, the routine is markedly
    different.) This type of routine works well for many athletes and many sports.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, the college and professional football players have a very elaborate warm-up routine, which includes
    stretches and calisthenics. Then some jumping and bouncing techniques are implemented prior to running a few
    1&frasl;2
    speed plays. For sports where the body can be forced into multiple positions at the very start of the game, each and
    every muscle must be warmed up.
</p>

<p>
    The above two types of warm ups are both excellent for the given sport. The main concept is that unless the muscles
    are warmed up, there is a much greater possibility of injury. I am amazed at many young athletes who have a warm-up
    routine for their school sports or recreational softball team. They would never dream of playing an intercollegiate
    game of football or race at a track meet without warming-up. However, when it comes to a day of skiing or a hard day
    of manual labor, they often never even think about warming-up the muscles.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch stretching exercises really should be looked upon as a sport when the intensity levels reach a moderate
    or moderately-severe level of discomfort. The muscles have to be warmed up or the chance of injury is higher. While
    stretching exercises are the very best way for checking for partially injured muscles and checking for range of
    motion, they serve as only a part of a good total warm-up process.
</p>

<p>
    I like to compare and experiment with various warm-up techniques before proceeding to stretch receptor lengthening.
    Many different warm-up techniques can be found in almost any book on exercising. This is an excellent way of
    comparing a specific warmup technique with those of the
    <u>Opti-stretch set</u>. It is nice to have two or three different types of warm-up techniques depending on the
    activity you want to engage in. One technique is utilized when there is only a short warm-up period. Another
    technique may be used as an optimum warm-up method for the start of a very intense activity. Still others might need
    to be used to avoid fatiguing the muscles when immediate maximum strength exertion of the muscles is required, as in
    a sprint or race. Stretching, too long (over three minutes per muscle) or too hard, can fatigue muscles. This may be
    a factor in some Olympic sprinters no longer performing stretching exercises immediately before a race.
</p>

<p>
    Muscles can be significantly fatigued at the moderate and higher discomfort level of stretch. This is one of the
    reasons why at these levels,
    <u>Opti-stretch sets</u>
    are recommended for only two to three sets per workout session. Avoiding fatigue is important in reducing the chance
    of injury. This is also why high levels of stretch intensity should be avoided prior to certain athletic sports
    event.
</p>

<p>
    Considering time efficiency and effectiveness together, the Opti-stretch warm-up technique is the best I have found
    for the main core muscles of the body. Each of the Optistretch stretching exercises isolates specific core muscles.
    Once these core muscles are properly warmed up, the peripheral muscles are usually ready to go (unless there is a
    specific problem or injury to a peripheral muscle). In extreme activities, calisthenics are often performed to test
    for and ensure peripheral muscle warm up.
</p>

<p>
    The bottom line is that stretching exercises are only
    <u>one type</u>
    of warm-up technique. Other warm-up techniques are just as effective in warming up certain muscles prior to
    activities. However, for warming up muscles, checking for injury and assessing optimum range of motion for a given
    activity, stretching exercises are extremely effective. Also, warming up the muscles is imperative prior to
    proceeding on to stretch receptor lengthening techniques.
</p>

<p>
    In properly cooling down fatigued muscles, warm-up exercises have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing
    lactic acid build up. This helps prevent stiffness and soreness the following day after overexerting muscles.
