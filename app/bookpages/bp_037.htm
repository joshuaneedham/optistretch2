    <h3>16. CHIN BACKWARDS</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_047.png"/>

    <p>a. &nbsp;This is a difficult stretch to perform correctly. In the standing position, place the dominant hand on
        the chin. Next place the other hand over the dominant hand. Close the mouth firmly for support but do not clench
        the teeth. Place the head in a slightly forward position.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Slowly apply backward pressure to the chin while exhaling. The stretch should be felt in the neck at the
        base of the skull.</p>

    <p>Notes: It may be necessary to try various levels of head tilt to find the maximum level of stretch at the back of
        the neck. Be particularly careful not to make the jaw area sore.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If one side of the base of the skull feels tighter than the other, this is considered a risk factor.</li>
    </ol>
