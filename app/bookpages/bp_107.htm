	“LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED”<br><i>– Euripides, circa 428 BC</i>

    Many scientific discoveries have occurred by having a baseline knowledge, which allows the scientist to recognize
    chance occurrences or patterns that otherwise might go unnoticed.

    The knowledge base included 10 years of college with 4 different degrees. The Masters degree in Zoology with an
    emphasis on comparative vertebrate anatomy and physiology would later become invaluable in both approaching and
    solving some of the complex problems of back pain. He graduated from the University of Utah School of Medicine in
    1982. Three years of General Surgery Residency allowed multiple rotations in Orthopedic Surgery and Neurosurgery of
    the spine. Next, 2,600 hours of Emergency Room practice (including Denver General) and 5,100 hours of Urgency Care
    Clinic practice were accomplished. A residency in Anesthesiology and a fellowship in Pain Management (graduating in
    1990 from Texas Tech University) followed. He served as Interim Director of Pain Management at Oregon Health
    Sciences University for three years prior to entering into private practice. He no longer practices clinical
    medicine and is involved full-time in back pain research and development.

    Investigational accomplishments include development of the harvesting technique for maximal preservation of
    endothelial cells in saphenous vein by-pass grafts. Also, he developed a new technique for allowing endothelial
    cells from saphenous vein segments to be visualized first under direct light microscopy and segments of interest to
    be studied under Electron Microscopy.

    The chance occurrence was to catch a 250 patient from falling while working as a Physical Therapy Aide. The
    resultant back strain that took two full months to essentially heal left the author with a back that “never was the
    same”. The next 23 years of reoccurring back strain allowed the author to compile a personal knowledge data base of
    reoccurring back strain, which statistically occurs in only 0.3% to 10% of the population. Of 2000 individuals
    interviewed, he was in a group referred to as “frequent reoccurring severe and moderate back strain episodes”. He
    was in a group considered to be the “worst of the worst” regarding “Benign Back Pain”. Following a fourth severe
    strain at age 38, he was forced to significantly modify his high activity level due to frequent reoccurring strains
    of 2 or 3 times per month. In that 7year period, he could no longer snowmobile, snow ski or lift anything over 60
    pounds. One evening on returning from work, he lifted his little 4-year-old and strained his back. He realized that
    unless something was to change, he would most likely be locked into a life of minimal activity and never be able to
    share with his child the activities he used to enjoy. His ancestors had back pain, his father had several episodes
    of back strain and chances were high that his children would be plagued with back pain. Deciding to leave “no stone
    unturned”, he studied “everything” known about benign back pain.

    Back strain is very complex. However, with identification of the major cause of low back muscle strain, citing
    previous investigational work that has identified three anatomical variants of the psoas muscle complex and
    discovering two other anatomical variants of that muscle complex has allowed a program referred to as Opti-stretch.
    Using scientific principles, it currently is the most effective way of rehabilitating the “weak link” in the low
    back responsible for “recurrent low back strain”. The next major goal of the author is to share this information and
    to help in formally generating a scientific database, which can be published in medical journals.
