<h3>FUNCTION WITH SPASM</h3>
<p>
    Opti-stretch data suggests that the muscles of the psoas complex can partially spasm and shorten the leg at the hip
    joint. First with myself, the right leg was measured to be 1 inch shorter than the left leg. With 1 inch of leg
    length difference, it is easy to notice the disparity, once you know what to look for. Custom-made
    1&frasl;2
    inch insole lifts were worn in the right shoe for 17 years (which only partially accommodate this shortening).
    Following six months of Opti-stretch techniques, which led to marked improvement in range of motion, I noticed that
    the right leg felt different. Comparing the leg length, the right leg was about as long as the left. The insole lift
    was removed from the right shoe. Everything felt great for about 1 month. Preparing for a lecture and demonstration,
    I was lifting 200-pound barbells. A weight lifter informed me that weight lifters usually warm up with 250-pound
    barbells. As my back was feeling great, I rapidly worked up to 250 pounds. Upon lifting the weight for the second
    time, I felt a slight strain in my left hamstring. Over the coarse of the next six hours, the pain became severe.
</p>

<p>
    It took almost one full month for the hamstring pain to reduce down to a mild level. I became quite disappointed
    that the injury was healing so slowly. I then fortuitously happened to note that the right leg was again
    approximately one inch shorter. I underwent steroid muscle injections and within a few days felt well enough to
    resume the Opti-stretch stretching exercises. Within two weeks, I felt great again and the right leg was very close
    to the same length as the left.
</p>

<p>
    Several months later, while experimenting with stretch receptors, I accidentally sustained another severe left
    hamstring pull. This injury took several months to heal. Again the right leg was noted to be about one inch shorter
    than the left. Approximately two months after the injury, Opti-stretch prolotherapy injections were again received.
    Within a week, the leg felt well enough to resume the Opti-stretch routine. In a few weeks, the leg felt great and
    lifting heavy weights could again be resumed. This time the weight amount was very gradually and slowly increased to
    200-pound barbells. After realizing the right leg could significantly shorten without being noticed, a new technique
    was devised to precisely measure the individual leg lengths. This technique is referred to as a height-o-gram (see
    Appendix A).
</p>

<p>
    To use a height-o-gram, simply tape a piece of paper to the wall. A thick book (such as a phone book) is placed on
    the head and a pencil on top of the book. The hands are used to place the pencil lead and the book against the
    paper, which is taped to the wall. The individualâ€™s weight is slowly shifted from one leg to another. The easiest
    way is to lift the heel of the right foot leaving the toes barely touching in order to maintain balance. Then repeat
    the process on the opposite side. The difference between the height of the top and bottom of the curve was very
    consistent and gives an accurate measurement of any leg length difference.
</p>

<p>
    Since that last injury, for a period of five years, the leg length difference has remained consistent at
    3&frasl;16<sup>th</sup>
    of an inch. Only one significant moderate back strain has been sustained despite extremely aggressive lifting.
    Lifting a large 150 pound object from ground level, I experienced mild to moderate discomfort directly over both
    sacroiliac joints. No leg length shortening occurred.

    fairly good symmetry of the upper back muscles.</li>
