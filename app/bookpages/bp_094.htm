    Please try to be fair when assessing the Opti-stretch technique. If you haven’t read portions of the book at least
    twice, feel comfortable with the information and possibly haven’t attended a seminar or received one-on-one
    instruction, then you may not be doing Opti-stretch correctly.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch is designed to be a very precise program. This allows trouble-shooting if there are problems and
    identification of individuals who might indeed be dealing with a pathologic problem rather than simply a muscle
    strain problem. First, it is imperative you
    <u>record</u>
    your range of motion measurements. The initial and one to two month re-measurements are essential. Second, choose a
    daily routine. The minimum is two stretches (Figure Four) and (Butterfly). Third, mark on the calendar when you
    stretch. As mentioned earlier, if there are significant lapses, you should restart your two-month program interval.
    It is difficult to emphasize enough these three simple steps if you are going to try the program and realistically
    expect the results that are possible with Opti-stretch.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch was designed for relatively healthy individuals with no significant medical problems. However, if you
    have made an honest attempt at learning all of the concepts and principles in Opti-stretch and as a healthy
    individual, you have still sustained an injury, this is something that needs to shared with others and myself. There
    is a good possibility that there are groups of individuals who, for whatever reason, may not tolerate Opti-stretch.
    Examples might be those individuals with extremely low or high pain thresholds. Also, there may be groups of
    individuals that for some reason are not able to properly feel a residual stretching sensation after the stretch has
    been completed. This could possibly be due to a mild neuropathy. These individuals may have to change to some other
    program.
</p>

<p>
    If you happen to have an adventuresome spirit, make sure that if you make any modifications of the Opti-stretch
    technique or the Opti-stretch stretching exercises, please refer to it as your own technique. As an example, take
    (Figure Four) for instance. This exact stretching exercise can be performed standing, sitting, supine and inverted. Only two of the four ways are
    safe for the Opti-stretch technique.
</p>

<p>
    A great deal of time and effort has gone into trying to make Opti-stretch both an effective and safe program. In the
    early days of Opti-stretch, I was extremely enthusiastic about the potential of the program. Approximately, 20
    different physicians were approached about their opinions. This ranged from general practitioners, to major
    University professors, and even to a medical society. The majority had no real interest when they were told it dealt
    with stretching exercises as the basis for correcting back pain. In all fairness to these physicians, it is
    difficult to condense all of the information contained in this book into a 20-minute conversation or a letter. Also,
    a few new theories have only recently evolved to explain various results following years of testing.
</p>

<p>
    I will always remain impressed by one fellow physician’s comments. He patiently listened to about a 45-minute
    presentation. Then he simply stated, “Even if your theories are right, you can’t make any money at this as a
    physician”. He was 100% correct. There is no way an average physician can instruct an individual in the Opti-stretch
    techniques due to the time constraints. However, two or three of the stretching exercises would make excellent
    screening techniques for certain types of physicians and health care providers. This is in part why the program had
    to at least be tested for several years.
</p>

<p>
    There are reasons why stretching exercises have continued to exist for thousands of years. There are also reasons
    why traditional medicine has not completely accepted any one technique with the exception of Physical Therapy.
    Hopefully, after reading the book you will have a different insight as to why controversies exist.
</p>

<p>
    Not only has time been invested, but also a great deal of personal sacrifice has occurred directly as a result of my
    enthusiasm to study this information and share it with others. Mild and moderate recurrent back pain syndromes often
    do not cause major lifestyle changes. However, “severe recurrent back pain syndrome” can be very devastating both
    mentally and physically. Moreover, statistically there may exceed over one million individuals suffering with this
    severe condition in the USA alone. If Opti-stretch can prevent the decades of needless back pain and incapacity that
    I experienced, in even a handful of individuals, then the sacrifices will have been worth it.
