<ol>
	<li>Anatomic cause of Benign (Common) Back Pain.
    	<ol type="a">
    		<li>For over 300 years, it has been documented that a common form of low back pain is located over the sacroiliac
    			joint. Many hundreds of researchers have attempted to identify the anatomical cause of this pain.</li>
			<li>Muscle complexes responsible for the majority of Benign Back Pain.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Psoas Muscle Complex – for the lower back, sacroiliac area and hips.</li>
					<li>Rhomboids – for the upper back [requires correction of (i)].</li>
					<li>For the neck, the Trapezius has long been recognized. The new discovery is that correction of (i) and (ii)
						greatly facilitates rehabilitation.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Anatomical variability and physiologic complexity of the Psoas Muscle Complex.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Several researchers have previously documented there are 3 different forms of the psoas muscle complex anatomy.</li>
			<li>Opti-stretch has discovered 2 other different forms of iliopsoas tendon length.</li>
			<li>This makes 18 different variants of the psoas muscle complex anatomy found in the general population.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>This correlates well with population statistics for back pain.</li>
					<li>Helps explain the complexity of Benign Back Pain.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Unless other accessory core muscles are first rehabilitated, the psoas muscle complex cannot be fully
				rehabilitated.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>“Recurrent Back Strain Syndromes”.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>“Psoas Short-Leg Low Back Strain”.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Functional leg shortening is nearly always seen.</li>
					<li>Anatomic leg shortening is usually not a significant factor.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>“Rhomboid Upper Back Strain”.</li>
			<li>“Trapezius Neck Strain”.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>“ACIM” (Asymptomatic Chronically Injured Muscle).
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The major cause of “recurrent back strain syndromes”.</li>
			<li>Found only in certain core muscles.</li>
			<li>Can develop following acute injury if 100% healing does not occur.</li>
			<li>Accounts for the majority of asymmetry seen in body movement.</li>
			<li>Other causes of asymmetry include:
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Indirect muscle spasm due to Pathologic (Malignant) Back Pain.</li>
					<li>Tendon and ligament shortening.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Determination of a healthy back or bad back (trick back).
		<ol type="a">
			<li>First need a Doctor’s evaluation to check for Pathologic (Malignant) Back Pain.</li>
			<li>Potential for self-assessment and evaluation.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Scientific screening test to indicate whether you have a healthy back.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Opti-stretch screening tests (Step 1 of the Opti-stretch Challenge).
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Beginning Program</li>
					<li>Intermediate Program.</li>
					<li>Advanced Program.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Risk factor analysis of “recurrent back strain” (asymmetry greater than 1 inch).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Opti-stretch Therapeutic Technique (Step 2 of the Opti-stretch Challenge).
		<ol type="a">
			<li>“Stretch receptor lengthening”.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Incremental movement technique.</li>
					<li>Incremental exhalation technique.</li>
					<li>Forced exhalation.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>2 to 6 months of work.</li>
			<li>Recognition of “secondary stretch receptors” past the age of 35.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Muscle Tone.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Improved scientific definition.</li>
			<li>Accurate, yet simple measurement of the range of motion for core muscles.</li>
			<li>Objective measurement of the “first sensation of stretch”.</li>
			<li>Four transition points for “stretch to pain transition” in healthy muscles.</li>
			<li>Aneroid manometer measurement.</li>
			<li>Potential for large scale standardization of healthy muscle tone for all of the various body types.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Maintenance (Step 3 of the Opti-stretch Challenge).
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Realistic and goal oriented stopping point.</li>
			<li>Time-efficient program.</li>
			<li>Cost effective.</li>
			<li>First aid for a life-time of healthy muscles.</li>
			<li>Activity level most precisely defines and best preserves a healthy back.</li>			
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>“Gold standard” for range of motion.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Stretch receptor lengthening beyond this point appears to offer no significant improvement for rehabilitating a bad back.</li>
			<li>Not necessary in all body types.</li>
			<li>Screening test for genetic hyperflexibility.</li>			
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Posture.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Recognition of correctable factors (i.e., ACIMs).</li>
			<li>Improved awareness to help provide a life-time of optimum activity.</li>			
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Involuntary (Instinctive) Stretching.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Found in all non-aquatic mammals.</li>
			<li>Comparison to stretching exercises.</li>
			<li>Help in determining key stretching exercises.</li>
