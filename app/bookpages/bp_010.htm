    <h2>SECTION I – BASIC CONCEPTS<br>FOR A HEALTHY BACK</h2>

    <div class="hrwrap">■ ■ ■</div>

<p>
    Too much simplification of a complex problem can be hazardous. Remember that the primary goal of Opti-stretch is to
    help individuals who recurrently strain a specific part of a single muscle in the back again and again. If these
    individuals can rehabilitate these chronically injured back muscles, their backs will return to a normal healthy
    status so they can enjoy age appropriate activities, for both an active and healthy lifestyle. Whether you are a kid
    age 6 or 86, these concepts can help reestablish and maintain a strain-resistant back.
</p>

<p>
    In sharing with you my thousands of hours of research, these concepts have the potential for helping literally
    millions of individuals. However, being a retired M.D., these are by no means any form of medical recommendation. In
    my opinion, Opti-stretch now offers an exciting and reliable program for rehabilitating the majority of “bad backs”
    due specifically to muscle strain. It does require a great deal of effort in simply learning the concepts and
    principles. Also, there is a fair amount of time commitment and work. However, the potential for helping future
    generations is enormous. With widespread implementation by the Dr. Mom’s of the world as a basic first aid approach
    to recurrent back strain, their kids can enjoy virtually any active lifestyle they choose and not develop <u>recurrent
    back strain syndromes</u>. Remember, this doesn’t mean they will not strain their backs on occasion. It means that
    these occasional strains will not be converted into a “recurrent back strain syndrome”.
</p>

<p>
    There is often a direct correlation between an active lifestyle and a healthy back. The concepts of a healthy back
    and active lifestyle are simple for the average person to understand. However, they are extremely difficult to
    specifically define and measure from a scientific standpoint. For example, if you have a bad back, what are the
    criteria to say you have moved from a bad back to a healthy back? Regarding active lifestyles, at which point do you
    move from a “normal” or average lifestyle to an above average life-style (i.e., certain Olympic athletes)? Is there
    a basic activity that an individual can perform comfortably which insures they have a healthy back (i.e., similar to
    professional movers or heavy laborers)?
</p>

<p>
    A good current working definition for a healthy back is having a back that lets you enjoy any activity you want,
    without constantly having to worry about reinjuring the back. Being able to “run, jump, work, play and keep up” with
    the other kids your age not only confirms back health but also improves overall general health. Currently, only 20%
    of the population will reach age 45-65 without ever having experienced a single day of back pain. Of the 2000
    individuals interviewed at the outset of the Opti-stretch research, some 400 individuals were found in this “never
    any back pain” category. This group was extremely helpful and insightful in defining from a scientific standpoint
    what a healthy back actually might be. For most of us with recurrent back pain, it is hard to even imagine an
    individual being so lucky.
</p>

<p>
    Could it be that these individuals never really did much; so consequently, they never hurt their back in the first
    place? Just the opposite was found. Many were blue-collar workers with very strenuous jobs and others were
    professional athletes. All were found to have very active lifestyles simply because they never had experienced any
    type of back pain. This means, they never had to worry about hurting their backs. They simply did whatever they
    wanted! In all of my research, I had never encountered a single research article dealing with this group and what
    makes them so different from the other 80% of the population.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, the individuals suffering from multiple severe bouts of recurrent back pain due to simple lifting
    strains were just the opposite. Activity levels were generally lower in this group. Also, if they did perform higher
    activity levels, these levels were both carefully chosen and cautiously performed so as not to reinjure their backs.
</p>

<p>
    There appeared basically three different groups based on personality types. The first group was very activity
    minded. They were determined not to let back pain get in the way of their life goals. They often succeeded in
    regaining a very active lifestyle and were able to perform strenuous work. These individuals are referred to as the
    “<u>activity rehabilitation group</u>”.
</p>

<p>
    Another group of individuals was also found to be equally very activity minded. They kept pushing and working to
    regain the active lifestyle they wanted following a significant back strain. Sometimes, the back would even be pain
    free for 5 years or more. Unfortunately, some activity would eventually flare up the identical back pain again.
    Sometimes, it would be heavy lifting or strenuous activity. However, sometimes an activity as simple as twisting to
    pick up a paper clip would throw the back into spasm. Many described their backs as having a “bad back” or a “trick
    back”. No matter how hard they tried and exercised, they were able to progress only to a certain level. These
    individuals described their back as “never being quite the same” following their initial significant injury.
</p>

<p>
    While young, these individuals considered themselves pretty normal because of the long intervals between bouts of
    back pain. However, by age 25-35, the recurrent injuries would become much more frequent. Also, the amount of weight
    lifted that would cause the reinjury, steadily decreased to such a level that they were eventually forced to start
    avoiding or even giving up various activities. This group was referred to as the “<u>persistent reinjury group</u>”.
    I was a member of this group.
</p>

<p>
    A third group was found. Each time the back pain reoccurred, these individuals would simply reduce their activity
    level. Eventually, the problem would go away. This is a very common phenomenon of “benign back pain” and the primary
    reason why after age 65 the incidence of <u>severe</u> back strain significantly decreases.
</p>

<p>
    A classic example was the lady who stated she had never had back pain on a questionnaire. In reviewing her old
    records, I found she had several visits to the clinic for benign back strain. When asked about the back pain some 2
    years prior she responded, “Oh that back pain. That all went away when I quit doing housework”. This group
    religiously avoided certain activities. By decreasing their activity level sufficiently, the back pain would not be
    a significant problem and appear to have gone away. This group was called the “<u>inactivity coping group</u>”.
    However, if this certain self-imposed activity level was exceeded and they, for some reason, returned to what would
    be considered normal activity for their age, reinjury frequently occurred.
</p>

<p>
    Approximately 15% of all individuals with back pain reported some type of known pathology. Surgery, arthritis, a
    severe accident, a broken bone or a herniated disc were some of the more common pathologies responsible for this
    group’s back problems. In this group, the only individuals who were extensively questioned and examined, were those
    who had essentially returned to normal activity levels.
</p>

<p>
    If this small study is any indication of the general population, the “<u>persistent reinjury group</u>” may
    constitute approximately 20% of the general population. This would amount to approximately 20-50 million individuals
    in the USA alone. This group displays certain similar physical characteristics and is referred to as having a
    “recurrent back strain syndrome”.
</p>

<p>
    “Recurrent Back Strain Syndrome” can be described as back pain that classically arises from some type of lifting
    injury that caused significant (either moderate or severe) back pain. This condition very seldom occurs in young
    children. Seldom does it start before age 13. Most commonly, the first significant strain occurs in ages 20-25. Many
    are seen by their doctors. Having practiced for 7 years in Emergency Rooms and Urgent Care Clinics, I am very
    familiar with what often happens. After a history and physical examination to assure there is no neurologic injury,
    an x-ray is often taken. The diagnosis in the vast majority would be that of “low back strain”. Although strain is
    often diagnosed, this examination is very important in order to make certain that no type of pathologic back pain
    exists.
</p>

<p>
    In <u>severe</u> back strain cases, usually medications are prescribed and the individual is referred to a Physical
    Therapist (depending on insurance). In the mid 1990’s, several good studies have shown that regardless of the
    treatment (including Chiropractic), the injury would heal in the same 1 to 2 months. The majority of these
    individuals would return to normal activity following the first severe strain. However, many reported to me the same
    thing that I had experienced. Even though after 2 months of healing and essentially able to return to the same
    activity level, “the back just never felt the same”.
</p>

<p>
    Over this 1 to 2 months, the back does not heal at a steady rate. Instead, the average person usually has multiple
    setbacks and minor reinjuries. The analogy is a badly sprained ankle. Once evaluated medically and determined to be
    a sprain, the ankle eventually goes on to heal. However, as the ankle gets feeling better, there would be a number
    of mild or moderate sprains (strains) before it would eventually heal. It is not like a broken bone (which I have
    also experienced several times). After the cast goes on, each day there is a little improvement until the pain is
    gone. There is a long pain free period until the cast comes off. The limb is weak and most extensive movement is
    quite painful. However, the limb rapidly returns to normal over a one or two week period. Seldom are there
    reinjuries or setbacks, unless a joint or severe muscle strain has occurred with the broken bone.
</p>

<p>
    In sharp contrast with the broken bone, a moderate or severe back strain will usually always have several reinjuries
    before it completely heals. Each is usually less severe than the one before. Eventually the periods between these
    strains lengthens until the area eventually returns to normal. This is something that the average individual learns
    to expect as a normal healing pattern. Also, they quickly learn which activities will usually cause mild reinjuries
    or setbacks. This is one of the reasons why, following 2 or 3 similar recurrent strains in exactly the same area,
    the individual recognizes they just have a strained muscle. Seldom do they seek medical attention. The reinjury
    again heals with multiple setbacks. Sometimes “zingers” will occur. These are sharp pains in that same area, which
    warn the individual that they are over-doing. The sharp pain that can then shoot down the leg or up the back, lasts
    only seconds. Once gone, the back usually seems all right. Most continue what they are doing, but try to avoid the
    exact twisting or lifting activity for at least several hours.
</p>

<p>
    After a couple of trips to the Emergency Room or doctor’s office in which they are told that their back is simply
    strained and it will eventually heal, many will self-diagnose the back pain in that same location as another
    reinjury. Frequently, they quit seeking further traditional medical attention for this problem. Many try
    Chiropractic, Naturopathy or Osteopathy treatment. There were 19 million visits to chiropractors alone in 1998. Many
    of these individuals reported that the pain would go away sooner. However, in many cases, these same individuals
    would find that the back pain still kept periodically returning.
</p>

<p>
    At that point, many will just quit returning to physicians and simply learn to live with the problem. Most try not
    to spread the fact that they have a “bad back”, and prefer not to talk about it with others. Therefore, traditional
    medicine has poor data about the natural history of this particular disease. In medical school, the above scenario
    is taught as a more severe pattern of benign back pain. The major difference is that following each injury, the
    muscle is believed to completely heal similar to the healing process of a broken bone. It is taught that the
    strained muscle will heal usually stronger and there should be no reason for that particular muscle to again become
    strained, unless there are significant strain forces in that location so as to damage (strain) the muscle again.
    Also, it is taught that the disease of benign back strain is usually selflimiting by age 65. This most likely occurs
    due to much lower incidence of heavy lifting at that age. So the disease usually does
    <strong><em>eventually</em></strong> go away.
</p>

<p>
    For those with the mild or moderate forms of “Recurrent Back Strain Syndrome”, they essentially enjoy a normal life
    with the exception that their “trick back” will occasionally “go out”. For those who have the severe form, it is
    entirely a different story. A full 2 months to heal the pain is very incapacitating. Put into perspective, each time
    these individuals severely strain their back is just like the average person breaking a bone and needing a cast
    applied.
</p>

<p>
    Many are forced to give up certain dreams regarding the various physical activities they like to perform in life.
    Many find their general activity level falls significantly below normal. This can have a serious effect on their
    happiness and their potential accomplishments in life. Also, the trillions of dollars spent annually by these
    subgroups in trying to cope with this condition are significant. Even worse yet, the <u>severe</u> recurrent pain
    category is not recognized as the truly incapacitating disease entity, which it can be. Socially, individuals in the
    <u>severe</u> recurrent back strain groups are compared with the milder forms of this recurrent problem. Many report
    that family and friends often blame them for not being able to better cope with this problem.
</p>

<p>
    The key to the scientific discoveries of Opti-stretch was in being able to talk comfortably with individuals in a
    non-threatening situation so they were very open about their condition. By then comparing and contrasting the “<u>never
    any back pain</u>” with the “<u>activity rehabilitated group</u>” and the “<u>persistent reinjury group</u>”
    important data was generated. This led to a review of Hippocrates’ early work in 400 BC. The “father of medicine”
    showed the importance of “movement therapy”. Much of this information was lost to the West during the Dark Ages.
    However, it appeared to be somewhat preserved in the East, which 800 years later became known as Yoga. Some believe
    that the “movement therapy” knowledge base also helped contribute to the emergence of several types of manipulation
    that arose in the USA during the late 1800’s (i.e., Chiropractic and Osteopathy).
</p>

<p>
    Traditional medicine adopted the specialty of Physical Medicine and relegated the more common forms of
    rehabilitation to Physical Therapists. However, for the “Recurrent Back Strain Syndrome” groups, the above mentioned
    treatments were often not completely successful. Healing arts and programs like American Yoga, Pilates, Callanetics,
    Egoscue technique and hundreds more emerged. Some reported significant successes. The prototype of “movement
    therapy” has been that of Yoga. It is frequently heralded as a 2000-year-old program that can help back pain.
    However, when twice formally evaluated by the American Medical Association, there appeared no significant benefit
    that would promote adoption into mainstream medicine. In my interviews, several individuals stated that they had
    tried Physical Therapy and had finally found relief in non-traditional movement therapy programs. It became apparent
    these various programs were valuable in helping at least certain types of benign back pain. However, why would one
    individual benefit and become significantly rehabilitated, while another would continue to suffer with recurrent
    injuries?
</p>

<p>
    Individuals reporting rehabilitation through “movement therapy” (i.e., Yoga, Pilates and other groups) were
    contrasted with individuals who felt they really didn’t benefit much at all from these modalities. Three main
    reasons were found. First, some of the programs did not specifically address all of the main functions of certain
    core muscles. Secondly, to obtain an advanced proficiency in any of these programs was usually very time consuming
    and the cost of formal instruction rather expensive. Thirdly, there appeared to be certain genetic factors, which
    were influential. In themselves, the genetic factors do not appear to cause back pain or strains. However, once a
    moderate or severe strain has occurred, these genetic factors allow for the “Recurrent Back Strain Syndrome” to both
    more easily occur and become much more difficult to rehabilitate.
</p>

<p>
    To make a long story short, research theories were formulated. Implementation of these theories rehabilitated my
    back and stopped the persistent reinjury strains. In 6 months, my back was healthier than I could ever remember it.
    As stated earlier, from a scientific standpoint, it is very difficult to prove an individual has achieved a healthy
    back. I felt the best way to prove this to myself would be to work for months in various heavy lifting, blue-collar
    jobs. This was something I was unable to do on a regular basis after age 22. Mild and moderate strains did occur,
    but not in the same location that they had for the past 23 years. These mild new location strains proved very useful
    in being able to more fully evaluate the concepts and theories of Opti-stretch. Also, it demonstrated that my “weak
    link” had rehabilitated.
</p>

<p>
    The information led to the development of three <span>screening tests</span>, which can actually demonstrate that a
    recognizable problem truly does exist. Any healthy individual can use the Beginning Program screening test.
    Unfortunately, accurate measurements are more difficult to consistently reproduce. The Intermediate Program
    screening test allows for very accurate and consistent measurements. However, if you feel any type of stretch while
    getting into these initial positions in order to start the stretching exercise, this is not acceptable. This was the
    main reason for developing a Beginning Program. The Advanced Program for Children and Fit Athletes represents
    stretches, which if they can be comfortably performed, are most consistent with the movements which can be obtained
    in the “<u>never had back pain</u>” group.
