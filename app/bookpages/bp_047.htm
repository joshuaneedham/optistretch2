<h3>INTENSITY OF STRETCH</h3>

<p>
    “More is not better!” This is commonly referred to the “just right phenomenon” or the “Goldie Locks phenomenon”. If
    you are stretching with the proper breathing technique and the proper incremental-movement technique, either too
    little or too much intensity will slow your progress. Any comfortable level where you are still seeing progressive
    stretch receptor lengthening and general well being of the muscle, is an adequate intensity level. However, some
    will try to press the envelope (press to more extreme intensity levels). If you think of your daily stretches as
    significantly uncomfortable, you are probably stretching with too extreme of an intensity level. If you are feeling
    any
    <u>residual stretch</u>
    or discomfort in the muscles after stopping the stretching exercise, this is a dangerous level. It is defined as
    stretching in the severe discomfort range. While it is not recommended, some individuals try to learn where this
    level is. If they stay just under this level, this is considered the moderately-severe range. This is considered to
    be the maximum safe level of stretching intensity. Most stretching exercises only require a moderate discomfort
    level.

<p>
    Only Intermediate exercises “Sitting Nose to Knee” – (Figure Four) and “Supine Straight Knee to Nose” should be used
    in this moderately-severe range. For learning purposes, the “Sitting Knees to Floor” – (Butterfly) can be used to
    experience sensitive muscles, which can be most safely pushed into the
    <u>residual stretch</u>
    range. It is imperative not to enter this range with any of the more central core muscles of the back

<p style="font-weight:bold;">
    Your intensity level is too extreme if any of the following occur.
</p>

<ul style="font-weight:bold;">
	<li>Any sensation of residual stretch.</li>
	<li>Any stiffness or soreness the following day.</li>
	<li>Repeating a stretch and the level of moderate discomfort is reached noticeably sooner than the time before.</li>
</ul>
