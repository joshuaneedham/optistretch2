<p>
    If you had any significant tightness or problems with the Screening Test Stretches, or if you are over age 45, you
    should consider starting at the beginning level. This is both an easier and safer level to start out at. Upon
    completion of the Beginning Program, you should be able to comfortably get into the starting position of each of the
    exercises in the Intermediate Therapeutic Program.
