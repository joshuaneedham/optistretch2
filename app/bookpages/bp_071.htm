<h3>8. RANGE OF MOTION</h3>

<p>
    In medicine, range of motion is the distance a given joint will move by the muscles powering that joint for a
    specific plane of motion. Many comprehensive Orthopedic textbooks have multiple pages of normal values for the range
    of motion of any given joint. “Stretched range of motion” is a valuable tool for physical therapists. It is a
    technique commonly used to regain normal joint range of motion. Seldom is it routinely measured and reported in
    textbooks. In part, this is because the variability is so large within a given population. However, Opti-stretch has
    found that if double-jointed individuals are placed in a separate group, the stretched range of motion is quite
    uniform given age, gender, height, and frame size. If an optimum stretched range of motion can be predicted for a
    given individual, then the measured “stretched range of motion” would be directly proportional to muscle tone and
    indirectly proportional to tight muscles (given normal healthy joints, ligaments and tendons).
</p>

<p>
    Traditionally, joint motion is measured in the frontal plane and sagital plane (two separate planes). This is the
    best way of simplifying the body’s complex movement capabilities. Hip and shoulder joints are able to undergo
    significant rotation. Assuming up to 360 degrees in one-degree increments, this would make the flexion and extension
    slightly different in at least 360 different planes. In actuality, the body is infinitely more complex and fractions
    of a degree can make a huge difference in the movement of a joint. Not only are many joints able to undergo hundreds
    of different planes of movement, but the movement of one joint is effected by the position of other joints, usually
    in proximity to the joint. This allows significant coupling of a joint’s motion relative to the position of another
    joint.
</p>

<p>
    The easiest way to both describe and measure these complex couplings of joints is to fix the given limb and the
    opposite limb as much as possible. The one limb is then moved through a simple standard plane of motion. One very
    simple example is to extend the fingers and the thumb of one hand. Then touch the tip of the thumb to the palm of
    the hand, just below the little finger. Try to extend the fingers of the hand. The index and middle finger become
    difficult to fully extend.
</p>

<p>
    Traditionally, range of motion is measured in degrees of flexion, extension or rotation of the joint. A goniometer
    is a device that measures this angle. It takes a very skilled anatomist to generate any type of reproducible
    measurement when multiple joints (especially those of the spine) are involved. This suggests that a skilled
    anatomist needs to be present, or a photograph generated, each time the individual wants to obtain feedback
    regarding his or her improvement in stretching distance. By coupling the joints consistently and standardizing the
    position each time, the individual has excellent reproducible feedback as to the progress. These motions also
    closely simulate the complex movements the joints and muscles are normally called upon in order to perform certain
    more strenuous activities.
</p>

<p>
    To simplify the measuring technique even further, the movement is measured by the distance between two given objects
    (such as the nose and knee). Unfortunately, this data measured in inches cannot be accurately compared to other
    individuals, especially with different body types. Therefore, if you go to a medical textbook you will see range of
    motion only measured in degrees of the given angle of motion. While the Opti-stretch method of measurement is not as
    scientifically acceptable, it does provide extremely valuable and useful data to the individual. It also gives a
    measurement by which certain general but not exact comparisons can be made between individuals (i.e., some people
    have longer necks or noses).
</p>

<p>
    Coupling joint motion is not a new concept. In fact, the concept has been used in certain martial arts for thousands
    of years. However, this type of application used by Opti-stretch is not commonly utilized, partially due to its
    somewhat inferior scientific value. In my opinion, the value to the individual and to his or her personal trainer is
    well worth it.
</p>

<p>
    An example, is the “Sitting Nose to Knee” stretching exercise – (Figure Four). One of the muscles in question (the
    psoas muscle) travels over eight separate joints. In addition, movements of the vertebral facet joints are extremely
    difficult to measure with a goniometer. The individual range of motion of 14 separate joints would have to be
    measured individually to generate completely accurate scientific data for this one stretch alone. It would take over
    30 minutes to perform the precise measurements. In addition, accurate measurements of subtle rotations of the spinal
    vertebrae are extremely difficult, even with x-ray. The bottom line is that using the Opti-stretch techniques of
    specific joint fixation, a simplified process of measuring certain complex movements can be achieved, which is both
    accurate and reproducible for a given individual.
