    <p>a. &nbsp;Grab both knees at the same time.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Attempt to bring the knees to the chest.</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a slightly advanced exercise and should be practiced only after becoming comfort-able with the
            “Supine Knee to Chest”.
        </li>
        <li>This stretching exercise can put a great deal of stress on the low back so be very cautious
            to perform the exercise carefully and slowly.
        </li>
        <li>The head can rest comfortably on the floor or a pillow if the stretch bothers the shoulders
            or neck.
        </li>
