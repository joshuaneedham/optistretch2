<h3>PAIN FROM THE PSOAS MUSCLE</h3>
<p>
    Pain that originates from the psoas muscle also has a very unusual pattern. Direct pressure on the muscle or a
    relatively common infectious process on the surface of the muscle (called a psoas abscess) cause pain to be referred
    to the abdominal area. This is considered a normal referral pattern for this type of deep muscle. What has been
    overlooked in medicine is that, due to the tremendous complexity of the muscle, there might be other possible
    referral patterns.

    In lower back pain, one of the more common locations of pain is over the sacroiliac joint (see Figure 1 – Posterior
    Back Anatomy, page 16). For over 30 years, both doctors and scientists have repeatedly looked at this location and
    at the sacroiliac joint. The majority of researchers conclude that pain over the sacroiliac joint is
    <u>not</u>
    due to injury or pathology of the sacroiliac joint itself. The overwhelming majority of data suggests that the
    sacroiliac joint is essentially immobile, except during pregnancy or unusual abnormalities. It is generally accepted
    that the sacroiliac joint does not play a role in common low back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Millions of dollars have been spent researching this one specific area of low back pain because it is so common.
    Despite this extensive research, there has been no consensus as to
    <span>what actually does</span>
    cause this pain which has been recorded in this precise location for the past several hundred years.
</p>

<p>
    The next anatomically deeper structures to the sacroiliac joint are the iliacus, psoas major and psoas minor
    muscles. The psoas muscles have not been thought to cause referred back pain for at least two reasons. First is the
    belief that the psoas muscles have little function when it comes to lifting motions performed by the back. Also,
    when an abscess forms in the front portion of the psoas muscle the pain is referred to the abdomen. This would
    suggest that the front half of the muscle radiates to the abdomen while the back part of the muscle radiates to the
    back. Given normal anatomy and physiology, this would be considered highly unlikely. However, structures deep in the
    chest and abdomen are not wired neurologically like the rest of the body. For instance a heart attack victim
    commonly describes pain in the jaw, shoulder or even the left little finger.
</p>

<p>
    The best anatomical model for different types and locations of pain radiation is that of the abdominal aorta. This
    is the major blood vessel, which carries blood from the heart to the legs. Anatomically, it runs just in front of
    (anterior to) the psoas major muscle in the abdomen. They are both called retroperitoneal structures because they
    are deep to the peritoneal lining of abdominal cavity. In a disease state, the dissecting aortic aneurysm inner
    lining can separate from the outer lining. High-pressure blood can rush into this space and make the dissection
    worse. During the actual dissection, many patients complain of excruciating back pain (like someone is tearing their
    back out). Once the dissection has stopped, the patient then complains of severe
    <u>abdominal</u>
    pain. If the dissection again restarts, the excruciating pain resumes in the back. It is so painful that often the
    patient doesn’t even complain of the abdominal pain. I had the opportunity of caring for several of these patients.
    I was always amazed with how excruciating the individual would describe the back pain and how rapidly it would
    subside once the acute dissection had stopped. Then complaints of abdominal pain would again resume.
</p>

<p>
    Kidney infection and kidney stones are also classic examples of injury to structures in the retroperitoneal space
    and pain that is referred or radiated to the back. With kidney stones, the lower the location of the stone in the
    ureter, the lower the back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Kidney stones very low in the ureter can cause abdominal pain on that same side once the ureter leaves the
    retroperitoneal space and enters the abdominal cavity.

    In Anesthesiology Pain Management, several procedures require placing a needle safely through the back and into the
    retroperitoneal structures of the abdomen. Different approaches and paths are used to avoid the major nerves coming
    from the spine. The psoas muscle has the large femoral nerve running close to it. This and the location of other
    major nerves that exit from the spine make injection into this muscle extremely difficult. However, injecting the
    iliolumbar ligament of the back is a common technique in back pain rehabilitation. As mentioned above, the psoas
    complex lies directly deep to this structure. To insure that a needle could be passed through the iliolumbar
    ligament and safely into the psoas muscle, over 20 cadavers were dissected to insure no major nerves came close to
    this small area of the psoas. This research demonstrated the psoas muscle could be safely injected from the back.
    Injection of a lidocaine solution that will cause a minor burning sensation demonstrated that pain in the posterior
    or deep part of the psoas could cause referred pain to the back, at the injection site and the adjacent sacroiliac
    area as well.
</p>

<p>
    A clinical technique for injecting the psoas, the iliopsoas, the iliacus and the hip extensors muscles was developed
    for evaluating the theories of Opti-stretch. These injections proved helpful in severely inflamed psoas complex
    states. This study suggests that the psoas muscle is the major contributor to back pain that is located over the
    sacroiliac joint area.
</p>

<p>
    Another Opti-stretch study suggests the referred nature of this back pain. During severe back spasm due to
    myofascial strain, the pain is often in a band-like pattern and near the center of the spine. As the back heals over
    the next one to two weeks, the pain frequently changes to one side of the lower back area and often moves laterally
    to the area directly over the sacroiliac joint. After approximately a month, the constant pain even at rest is
    usually gone. However, upon bending backward at the low back level, even slightly, the sacroiliac pain will
    partially return. If a normal standing position is resumed, the pain goes away. This can be repeated multiple times.
    While in the standing erect position, there is no pain when pressing over the sacroiliac joint area. However, when
    the back is bent backwards and the pelvis tipped forward, the pain returns over the sacroiliac area. At this time,
    pressing over the sacroiliac area
    <u>does</u>
    cause an increase in pain. This pattern suggests that the pain sensation is actually coming from a referred source.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, the differences in the psoas complex anatomy contribute to risk factors that play a key role in back
    pain. The psoas muscle itself can refer or radiate pain specifically over the sacroiliac joint area, one of the most
    common locations for lower back pain. Fortunately, Opti-stretch has shown that by first identifying and then
    correcting risk factors associated with the psoas complex, both the incidence and severity of recurrent low back
    pain decreases in those susceptible individuals.
