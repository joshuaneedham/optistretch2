    <p>a. &nbsp;In the supine position, grab the right knee. The right heel should be placed on the outside edge of the
        left thigh..</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Bring the right knee toward the cross chest or the left axilla.</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat the process for the left knee.</li>
        <li>This puts a stretch on the right buttocks muscles called the major hip flexors. The pyriformis muscle is
            part of this group.
        </li>
        <li>Initially, be very slow and careful with this group of muscles, as these major hip flexors can be very
            tender and sensitive to this stretch.
        </li>
        <li>The head does not need to be raised, if there are any neck problems.</li>
    </ol>
