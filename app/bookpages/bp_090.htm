<h3>20. ARTHRITIS</h3>
<p>
    There are some reports by participants in Opti-stretch that minor common arthritic problems are either improved or
    eliminated. These individuals also noted a decrease in the sensation of stress in the joints.

<p>
    Movement and anti-inflammatory medications are the most commonly recommended forms of therapy for all common
    (degenerative) arthritis. Opti-stretch theory proposes that, by lengthening the stretch receptors and rehabilitating
    tight muscles, the joint moves with less stress. This lessening of the stress allows healing of the inflamed joint
    tissue, which is a definite part of arthritis. Whether Opti-stretch may be of some help in moderate or severe
    arthritic conditions is doubtful and has not yet been evaluated.

<p>
    Also, of note, is the observation that moderate and severe arthritic conditions have shown to be a significant
    impediment to re-toning injured muscles (ACIMs).
