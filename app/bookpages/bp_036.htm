    <p>a. &nbsp;Place the left hand on the chin and gently push the chin so it is pointing at a 90-degree angle. The tip
        of the chin should be pointing directly toward the center of the right shoulder.</p>

    <p>Note:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The neck is extremely sensitive to stretching exercises. Be sure to proceed extra slowly and carefully to
            avoid injury.
        </li>
        <li>2. Repeat the process on the opposite side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the range of motion is 1&frasl;2 inch less on one side compared to the other side, this is a risk factor
            for neck pain on the side demonstrating the tighter muscle.
        </li>
        <li>When the chin is placed on the right shoulder, the stretch is often felt on both sides of the neck. However,
            the stretch should primarily be felt on the opposite side (left side). If the primary stretch is felt on the
            same side (right side in this case), this is considered a risk factor.
