<h3>6. STRETCH RECEPTORS</h3>
<p>
    “Stretch receptors” is another term that varies between the medical community and the general public. Muscle stretch
    receptors have been specifically identified on a cellular
    basis and extensively studied in animals. Also, there exist specific stretch receptors of tendons that make the leg
    jump when tapped with a doctor’s reflex hammer. Most of this physiology has been worked out in the animal model.

<p>
    The process by which the above-mentioned receptors (and possibly other types of muscle receptors) produce the graded
    sensation of discomfort that human beings feel when a muscle is stretched, may actually be much more complex than
    previously thought. The subtleties of this particular phenomenon are difficult to experiment with in animals and
    even more difficult to experiment with in humans.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch studies suggest that there may be at least two or more separate stretch receptors, a primary and an
    accessory receptor. The accessory stretch receptor is usually not apparent during youth or in toned muscles. As the
    individual ages and tone starts to diminish, the influence of the accessory stretch receptor becomes more apparent.

    Children are able to obtain an optimal stretch of their muscles at just about any time of the day. Individuals over
    35 years of age often notice a sensation related to the accessory stretch receptor that is felt consistently at a
    certain distance of stretch. If the muscle is then warmed up, using various techniques, the muscle can be stretched
    further to the primary receptor level. Once the muscles are warmed up and stretched to the optimum, the accessory
    stretch receptor is then dormant until the muscles are immobile for at least two to three hours. After this
    immobility, the accessory stretch receptor is reset to precisely the original degree of limited stretch.

<p>
    This helps to explain why, as one ages, the muscles seem to get stiff following a long plane or car ride. It also
    may explain why individuals, over the age of 35, may not see a significant change if practicing stretching routines
    that only engage the accessory stretch receptor. For this reason, a warm up phase is built into the Opti-stretch
    Therapeutic Technique.

<p>
    One thing is clear; there are several different types of stretch receptor conditions. Optistretch is designed to
    help you differentiate between an acute injury stretch receptor, a chronic injury stretch receptor, an accessory
    receptor and a primary receptor. If an accessory stretch receptor exists, one can safely learn to work through to
    the primary receptor by warming up the muscle and thereby, helping to avoid injury of this more sensitive receptor.
    However, if one tries to work through a primary receptor, or an acute injury stretch receptor, the chance of
    significant injury to the muscle is extremely high.
