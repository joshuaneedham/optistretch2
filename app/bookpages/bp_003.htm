<p>
    Back pain negatively effects millions of individuals, alters activity levels and causes economic hardships for many
    Western nations.
</p>

<p>
    Once the back has been severely strained, there appears to be no modality that can shorten the one to two months
    that are normally required to heal the injury.
</p>

<p>
    Once significantly strained, several back muscles are extremely sensitive to recurrent strain patterns. <u>Recurrent
    back strain syndrome</u>
    is a spectrum of recurrent injury with classic signs and symptoms. In the most severe form, it can, over decades,
    lead to significant physical incapacity and a serious type of frequently recurring back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Muscle strain has long been known as the primary cause of back pain. Yet, the <u>precise</u>
    <u>muscle or muscles</u>, which have been strained, still remains a question of significant controversy. Indeed, the
    precise cause of back pain, due to muscle strain, has long been considered an <u>enigma</u>. Most sufferers are told
    the muscle strain will eventually go away. However, after one severe strain, many individuals state that, “their
    back was never quite the same”.
</p>

<p>
    This strained area of the back then becomes extremely susceptible to reinjury. In over 2000 individuals questioned,
    approximately 10-25% maintained an active lifestyle and simply lived with the recurrent bouts of back strain. Later
    in life, due to decreased healing capabilities of the body, often the length of time necessary to heal recurrent
    strains would become significantly prolonged. This led to an intolerably frequent amount of strains and subsequent
    decrease in activity levels.
</p>

<p>
    Some 50% of common back strain sufferers would continue to decrease their activity level and thereby avoid strains
    for long periods.
</p>

<p>
    Another 25% were lucky enough to markedly rehabilitate their back. A great deal was learned from both this group,
    and the 20% of the total population who reported never straining a muscle in their back, despite very active
    lifestyles.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch, following extensive scientific research, has demonstrated the existence of
    <u>risk factors</u>
    responsible for recurrent strain to the same area of the back. If these risk factors are decreased or completely
    eliminated, the chance of strain recurring in the exact same location is markedly decreased. This area of the back
    can become optimally healed, and is no longer a “weak link”.
</p>

<p>
    The key, to building healthy muscles in the back, is first to tone the muscles. Later, the muscles must be
    strengthened and then conditioned. Without first toning the muscles, following a severe strain injury, it is
    difficult to strengthen the muscles, beyond a certain level. When exceeding this certain level of strength, strains
    will frequently reoccur. The knowledge of which muscles (i.e.,
    <u>psoas muscle complex</u>) are most commonly strained in the back, allows Opti-stretch to specifically target
    these muscles. Once these muscles are toned, they can be rehabilitated to a healthy level.
</p>

<p>
    It has long been known that there are two major functions of muscles. The first is to contract and provide movement
    to the body. The second function is to spasm in order to protect injuries to bones, ligaments and even the muscles
    themselves. This prevention of movement allows the body to heal. Opti-stretch has demonstrated that certain muscles
    can exist in a state of partial spasm for years and even decades. Unless, the muscles are isolated and specifically
    evaluated, these “asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (ACIMs)” are very difficult to detect.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch stretching exercises isolate the major core muscles of the back, which are responsible for the majority
    of recurrent back strain. ACIMs, shortened tendons and other conditions can now be identified.
</p>

<p>
    Using the same stretching exercises, a process referred to as
    <u>stretch receptor lengthening</u>
    can often restore optimal tone to the muscles. Stretch receptor lengthening is accomplished using a specific
    incremental stretching technique combined with an incremental breathing technique. Over a considerable time (2 to 6
    months), large increases in muscle tone can be documented.
</p>

<p>
    The next important step is to strengthen the muscles. The muscles then need to be conditioned. Many good programs
    already exist for these two important steps.
</p>

<p>
    In summary, there now exist
    <u>screening tests,</u>
    which can evaluate whether an individual is susceptible to recurrent back strain. Certain risk factors can be
    detected. This screening technique is valuable in recording the range of motion for all individuals, whether they
    have had back pain or not. Unfortunately, in this day and age, serious injuries from auto accidents and falls are
    very common. By knowing precisely where the individual’s range of motion was prior to the accident, this information
    could be very helpful in achieving the most total rehabilitation possible.
</p>

<p>
    Despite decades of recurrent back strain, many individuals have been able to significantly rehabilitate their backs.
    While there are several other causes of back pain, recurrent muscle strain is by far the most common. Opti-stretch
    has the potential for helping millions of individuals regain a healthy back.
</p>

<p>
    Certain risk factors can be determined even in children. By age six, programs can be instituted to help decrease the
    risk factors (see Dr. Mom section). In children and
    young adults, the risk factors can be rapidly improved. By age 55, reduction of risk factors often becomes much more
    difficult. This is due primarily to age, joint injuries and arthritis.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch
    is an effective scientific program for core muscles with measurable results. It is both cost-effective and
    time-efficient. It is the best program I have found in my quest to leave no stone unturned in procuring a healthy
    back.
