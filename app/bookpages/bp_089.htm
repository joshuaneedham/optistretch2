<h3>19. DYSPAREUNIA</h3>

<p>
    Dyspareunia is one-sided abdominal pain in females during intercourse. It appears to be a mechanical stimulation of
    pain fibers, particularly when significantly extra stress is placed off the midline plane or if other rather
    significant forces are generated. Generally, this condition is alleviated by a complete gynecological work-up.
    However, several individuals were referred to our Pain Management Clinic, as the source of the pain could not be
    found. I was impressed at the similarity of each story and how devastating it was for them and their families. All
    had undergone extensive tests and even exploratory abdominal surgery to leave no stone unturned in this serious
    problem.

    At that time, the Pain Management Clinic had nothing to offer these unfortunate women. Now, at least in theory,
    Opti-stretch may be helpful. With Opti-stretch, we know the psoas complex can be very tender if these muscles are
    palpated while in a chronic injury state. Due to the depth of the psoas muscle in the pelvis, the presumably
    affected segment of psoas cannot be palpated. However, both above and below this area the psoas complex can usually
    be easily palpated for tenderness, especially in females with near ideal body weight.

    Anatomically, both the ovary and the uterus are partially attached directly over the psoas muscle. Therefore,
    significant movement of these female organs could cause abdominal discomfort from the anterior surface of the psoas
    muscle if the individual had an asymptomatic chronically injured psoas muscle (ACIM). By using Opti-stretch toning
    of the psoas muscle complex, the muscle becomes less tender to palpation. Whether this might help in certain cases
    where every other form of therapy has failed is unknown. However, for those brave enough to undergo surgery to
    evaluate the problem, a couple of months of stretching exercises, if indicated, may well be worth the effort in
    “leaving no stone unturned”.
