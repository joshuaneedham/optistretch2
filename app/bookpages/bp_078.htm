<h3>14. THE PSOAS MUSCLE ANATOMY</h3>
<p>
    The psoas complex is a complex combination of three separate muscles. The
    <u>psoas major</u>
    muscle, the
    <u>psoas minor</u>
    muscle and the
    <u>iliopsoas</u>
    muscle. The
    <u>psoas major</u>
    and
    <u>psoas</u>
    <u>minor</u>
    muscles have their origin near the diaphragm in the chest cavity and travel along the antero-lateral vertebrae from
    T11 to L5 (from the diaphragm to the pelvis). Both then form fusiform muscles that travel over the iliacus muscle
    and is no longer attached closely to bone. From an anatomy standpoint this area of the muscle would be the weakest
    and most susceptible to injury. This area lies just deep to the sacroiliac joint area (to be discussed later). Both
    muscles travel over the iliacus muscle down the back wall of the pelvis. In the lower pelvis, the psoas minor muscle
    inserts on the pubic bone. This muscle does not leave the true pelvis. In contrast, the psoas major fuses with the
    iliacus muscle in the lower pelvis and becomes the iliopsoas muscle. While anatomical considered as one muscle, the
    muscle fibers of each muscle are often divided by a septate fascia.

<p>
    As the
    <u>iliopsoas</u>
    muscle travels outside the abdomen through the inguinal canal, the muscle then splits into two separate muscle
    segments at the level of the groin. Each segment attaches by muscle fiber or tendon to a slightly different part of
    the medial top of the femur called the lesser trochanter. Careful dissection of the iliopsoas muscle shows a fibrous
    septate partition that keeps the muscle fibers of the psoas and iliacus muscles separate. The iliacus muscle fibers
    separate and attach to the lesser trochanter either as muscle fibers or as a tendon. The psoas major muscle usually
    always forms at least a
    1&frasl;2
    inch tendon, which wraps slightly around the lesser trochanter to attach. It attaches to the lesser trochanter at a
    slightly different plane than does the iliacus portion. This could explain why the muscle fibers of the psoas appear
    to have more stress placed on them in various leg positions.
</p>

<p>
    Also, a never before reported anatomical variation was noted. In certain cadavers, a significantly longer length of
    the tendonous attachments were observed, if an iliacus tendon was present. These anatomical differences, which
    appear to be genetically determined, help to explain the observed tendon shortening of the psoas muscle complex. In
    theory, the longer tendon will have more chance of shortening with injury. It also helps explain why there are
    various patterns of psoas muscle primary injury and reinjury. More is explained in the following section dealing
    with physiology.

<p>
    Anatomically this muscle and muscle complex are found in the majority of vertebrate life (except marine mammals).
    However, the exact anatomy and physiological function of the psoas complex muscles are completely unique in man,
    because man is the only species that walks fully erect.
</p>

<p>
    The
    <u>psoas minor</u>
    muscle attaches to the lumbar vertebrae and travels down to attach to the pubic bone of the pelvis. It does not
    travel through the inguinal canal nor attach to the iliacus muscle. It has been documented by various authors to be
    absent in large percentages of various races (see Table 3, page 143). When absent, the psoas major muscle will
    sometimes send muscle fibers to attach to the pubic bone presumably to imitate the function of the psoas minor. The
    exact incidence of this anatomic occurrence has not been fully documented.

<p>
    This describes only a small portion of the complexity of the muscles in the body appropriately referred to as the
    Psoas Complex. As you will see in the next section, the physiology of this muscle complex is even more “complex”.
    This is in part because not everyone has the same configuration of these muscles.
