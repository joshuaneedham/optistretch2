    <p>a. &nbsp;In either the kneeling or standing position reach the left hand behind the back and attempt to touch the
        lower scapular area. Repeat on the other side.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Next attempt to reach over the shoulder with the right hand and touch the upper scapular area. Repeat on
        the other side.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;Then attempt to touch the fingers. Fingers should be overlapped but not grabbed for measuring the
        “Finger Touch”. Following measurement, the fingers can be grabbed to increase the stretch on the shoulders.</p>

    <p>d. &nbsp;This stretching exercise is usually quite easy for younger children. An optimum “Finger Touch” is where
        the fingers can overlap to nearly touch the palm of the hands. When the fingers are grabbed, they allow for
        optimum range of motion of the shoulders.</p>

    <p>Notes: Reaching the hand behind the back to the lower scapular area puts a significant strain on the same side
        anterior joint capsule of the shoulder and rotator cuff. Proceed very slowly and be especially careful not to
        strain the anterior shoulder area.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A 1-inch difference measured between the fingertips comparing the two sides is a risk factor. Then measure
            the absolute height of each arm. Determine which is the tighter shoulder. The tighter shoulder is a risk
            factor for upper back and neck pain on that particular side.
        </li>
        <li>If the fingertip touch is fairly symmetrical on both sides but the distance between fingertips exceeds 2
            inches, this should also be considered a relative risk factor.
        </li>
