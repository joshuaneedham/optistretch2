    <h3>13. RHOMBOID PULL â€“ GREATER AND LESS RHOMBOID MUSCLE EXERCISE</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_044.png">

    <p>a-b. &nbsp;In either the standing or kneeling position, place the arms out level and horizontal. Bend the elbows
        so the hands are close to the chest. Pull the elbows toward the back as if to touch the elbows together. The
        forearms should be pointing in a downward direction. The hands should be clenched.</p>

    <p>c-d. &nbsp;Place the elbows 2 inches above level and repeat the process.</p>

    <p>e-f. &nbsp;Place the elbows 2 inches below level and repeat the process.</p>

    <p>Notes: The stretch should be felt in the front of the shoulders on each side. However, the important sensation is
        the tightening sensation between the shoulder blades.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the pull and muscle tightness or tenderness can be felt more on the right or left of midline in the
            shoulder blade area, the tighter side has the risk factor for a rhomboid chronic injured muscle. The goal is
            to be able to pull very slowly to full strength and have the tension felt in-between the shoulder blades
            feel equal.
