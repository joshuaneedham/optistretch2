		<li>The extreme scissors differs from the (Butterfly) in that the right foot is drawn as close to the groin as possible.
		The left foot crosses midline. In this position, the stretch focuses on two muscles that are
    	commonly tightened following certain knee injuries. If you have sustained a knee injury or have had trouble healing
    	a knee strain, this can be a very valuable stretching exercise. It is imperative to be extremely careful and gentle
    	while even getting into the starting position.</li>
		<li>In the beginning phases of this stretch, the left foot may need to be placed closer to midline until the thigh
    muscles become more toned.</li>
		<li>This shows the position for stretching the right knee.</li>
