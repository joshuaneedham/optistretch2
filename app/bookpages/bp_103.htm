    After performing an Opti-stretch set, rest the muscles at least 1 minute. Either perform the same exercise on the
    opposite side of the body or perform a similar exercise in the same general position (i.e., prone, kneeling or
    sitting).<br><br>
    </li>

	<li>
    Then repeat the set. If the muscles appear to be warmed up (which usually takes a week or two of practice to
    determine), proceed to your predetermined increased level of intensity. After two weeks of practice, this is usually
    to the moderate level. Following 2 months of practice this can maximally proceed to the moderately severe intensity
    level.<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>
    The intensity level is repeated usually twice on each side. Once a full one or two inches of increased range of
    motion has been achieved, (which usually takes 2 months), a total of three sets can be performed on the tighter side
    and two sets on the side that has the increased range of motion in order to narrow the asymmetry.<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>
    The maximum number of sets at the mild intensity level is determined by the amount of time one has to exercise a
    day. However, due to fatigue of the muscles, only 3 sets should be performed at any moderate intensity level or
    higher for a given exercise stretching session. In my experience, after this number of maximum predetermined sets,
    little is gained, time efficiency is decreased and the risk of injury increases significantly. “More is not always
    better.”<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>
    The number of exercise sessions per day can be as frequent as one every hour. This type of time commitment is
    usually unrealistic for the average individual. However, performing two or three exercise sessions per day on the
    weekends can significantly accelerate your progress. Exercise sessions can be broken down into abbreviated sessions
    of 2-4 exercises. Remember, with the warm up built into each exercise, if you have an extra 5 minutes of time a
    couple of exercises can be performed. (This is one type of exercise session that you don’t feel like you have to hit
    the showers upon completing.)<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>
    For the first 2-8 weeks, you need to be gentle and careful with your muscles. At the end of each exercise session
    you should feel as if you just had a relaxing deep muscle massage. (For many this can be a great and effective
    long-term level of exercise. For others, the intensity level has to be increased to achieve the results they desire.
    Still, the knowledge of performing the exercises to the level of a relaxing deep muscle massage is valuable for cool
    downs after sports, giving the muscles a little rest after days of intense workout or just relieving a little stress
    of the day. (This can be particularly beneficial for those who have trouble falling asleep.)<br><br>
