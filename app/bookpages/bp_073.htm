<h3>10. PROPRIOCEPTIVE NEUROMUSCULAR FACILITATION (PLF)</h3>

<p>
    The concept of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PLF) is important to mention. It is one of the more
    effective ways to stretch a muscle and to achieve stretch receptor lengthening of a muscle. It is frequently used
    when working with certain trainers and health care professionals. Basically, the trainer stretches a muscle until
    there is a mild to moderate stretch on the muscle. At that point, the individual being stretched contracts the
    muscle against a fixed resistance of the trainer, in an isometric fashion. As the muscle starts to fatigue, the
    muscle is then relaxed and slightly more force is placed by the trainer in order to stretch it further. The process
    is repeated until a moderate to moderately severe stretch is placed on the muscle. Certified personal
    trainers and licensed health care professionals should be the only ones doing this on another person.

<p>
    However, an individual performing stretches can use a similar technique. The resistance is simply a force applied by
    the arms helping to perform and control the stretch.
</p>

<p>
    PLF is not recommended at near maximum stretch. It is far too difficult to think about the amount of stress provided
    by the arms and then trying to think about a contracting force in the leg muscle. You need all your concentration on
    finding precisely the maximum end point. The risk of injury is too great by using PLF at near maximum stretch.
    However, it can be an effective warm-up technique if you are already familiar with it.
</p>

<p>
	As mentioned above, it is not necessary to know or use the PLF technique with Optistretch.
	<b>Warning; do <u>not</u> use PLF on the “Sitting Nose to Knee” – (Figure Four).</b>
</p>

<p>
    What happens is that an injury will occur to the psoas muscle on the opposite leg. To hold resistance for isometric
    contractions takes approximately 50 pounds of force for an average male. The same mechanics and forces would be
    analogous to standing on a step and keeping the left leg straight, to simulate stretching the left leg. Next, the
    individual would have to bend the right leg and place the foot on a one-foot high cinderblock. Next, if someone were
    foolish enough to reach down and pick up a 50 pound weight below the level of the left foot, this would place the
    same force on the right psoas muscle, as would the (Figure Four) exercise using PLF. The right psoas has to
    stabilize the back. A significant muscle strain of the right psoas is almost guaranteed, due to the twisting angle
    of the right psoas muscle used to stabilize the back in this position.
</p>

<p>
    Again, do not use PLF with (Figure Four). Nor is it advisable to use this with any other Opti-stretch stretching
    exercise, unless you know precisely what you are doing. It simply isn’t worth the risk.
