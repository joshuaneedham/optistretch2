    <p>a. &nbsp;In either the standing or sitting position, allow the head to tilt sideways touching the right ear
        towards the right shoulder. Do not elevate the shoulder.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Very gently provide a slight amount of stretch with either hand. Be careful! The neck can be easily
        strained in this position.</p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;A safer way to stretch the neck laterally and provide an excellent shoulder stretch is to bring the left
        straight arm to the ear. With the right arm, provide the force to bring the right ear to the right shoulder.</p>

    <p>Notes: This is one of the more sensitive stretches. It must be performed slowly and carefully to avoid any neck
        strain.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the one ear is further away from the shoulder compared with the other ear, this is a risk factor for the
            opposite side of the neck.
        </li>
        <li>If one side of the neck feels tighter, this is also a risk factor.</li>
    </ol>
