<p>
    You are now ready to take the Opti-stretch screening tests (which are the exercises in each program). If you are
    medically qualified, have no current injury or pain and in the “recurrent back strain” group or the “never any back
    pain” group, you are set. One other group may be considered. Previous herniated disc patients with recurrent back
    pain may consider the screening test if cleared for regular activity and at least six months out from a disc injury.
</p>

<p>
    For safety and efficiency, the majority of stretches are performed in the sitting position. All Opti-stretch
    Beginning and Intermediate stretching exercises are specifically designed so the stretching force can immediately be
    released. (This is why the Optistretch therapeutic stretch-receptor-lengthening technique must not be used on any
    other stretching exercises.)
</p>

<p>
    Find a comfortable carpet or an exercise mat. The Beginning Stretching Exercises were designed for even advanced age
    groups. You can find the Beginning Screening Test in the next chapter and the corresponding worksheets in the
    Appendix. Any difference of more than one to two inches on the left side versus the right side is considered to be a
    major risk factor.
</p>

<p>
    If you can comfortably get into the desired stretching exercise position, slowly and gently proceed to where you
    first feel a stretch of any kind. This “first sensation of stretch” will normally persist for at least 2 more inches
    of stretch and by definition is the range of
    <u>mild</u>
    stretch. At this point, another level of discomfort will appear (defined as
    <u>moderate</u>). Normally, this level of discomfort will persist identically until another
    <u>moderately-severe</u>
    level of discomfort will be felt (which is normally at least another couple of inches). The transition from mild to
    moderate is the best stopping point (especially if you are over age 45). Only if you have extensive experience with
    stretching, should the moderate discomfort limit be explored. Record your results.
</p>

<p>
    Upon recording the results of the Beginning Program screening tests, most can proceed to the Intermediate Program.
    If there is any sensation of stretch while carefully getting into the starting position, immediately stop. Most can
    safely proceed to the upper back and neck screening exercises. Record your results for these exercises in the
    Appendix.
</p>

<p>
    If any risk factors are detected, you may be in a high-risk category for “recurrent back strain” to reoccur. A
    common scenario is that if the muscles of the right side of the low back are tight, the right side of the upper back
    will be tight and the left side of the neck
    will be tight. You can easily confirm that the muscles are tender by simply massaging the muscles on each side. A
    great way to convince yourself is to get a deep muscle massage of the back and neck by a licensed massage therapist
    or someone knowledgeable about massage. Chances are high that they will confirm that you have tender and tight
    muscles with knots (trigger points)
    <u>on the same side</u>
    of the body that you found the tight muscles using the Opti-stretch screening test.
</p>

<p>
    A common misconception at this point is that “everyone has a left or right side of the body that is a little
    different”. This statement is partially accurate. In fact, the overwhelming majority (approximately 80%) of the
    population has this problem to one degree or another. However, 20% of the population does not. The majority of these
    individuals are also in the “never had any back pain” group. In fact, there is a high probability that you don’t
    even know someone in the “never had any back pain” group who enjoys a high to extremely high activity level.
</p>

<p>
    <u>Remember</u>
    that the Opti-stretch therapeutic programs were specifically designed for individuals with “recurrent back strain”
    and demonstrable risk factors, in order to correct these risk factors. The closer that you can get the left side of
    the body functioning like the right side of the body, the less difficulty you will have with “recurrent back
    strain”.
</p>

<p>
    If the Beginning and Intermediate screening stretches seem easy and no risk factors can be detected, go to the
    Opti-stretch Advanced Program. Easy completion of the Advanced Program screening test with no indication that one
    side of the body moves different than the other, means that you have passed Step 3 of the Opti-stretch Challenge.
    Chances are very high that you possess a healthy back. The goal for most at this level is a Maintenance Program. A
    yearly check is one option to make sure no risk factors have developed. Some individuals in their 50’s and 70’s can
    easily perform most of these stretching exercises. If you happen to be age 75 or older, and can still comfortably
    perform the Advanced Program screening test, I would enjoy hearing from you. There are many individuals who are
    extremely active at age 85 (i.e., still continue to snow ski). For the baby-boomer generation, this is both a
    realistic and desirable goal. Opti-stretch can be a helpful tool in attaining this goal.
</p>

<p>
    Make certain to record your results. While 20% of the population appears almost immune from common back strain,
    serious accidents or injuries can happen. Data generated from Opti-stretch can be extremely valuable in knowing when
    you are back to 100% following something similar to a car accident or a broken bone.
