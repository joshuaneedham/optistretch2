<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>

<h3>SHOULD EVERYONE TRY OPTI-STRETCH?</h3>

<p>
    Everyone who is healthy enough to try the stretching exercises should take advantage of this knowledge. First, if
    there is no problem, the information serves as an excellent reference as to what your normal range of motion is,
    should a significant injury occur. Second, by completing the program a great deal of knowledge is gained about the
    musculo-skeletal system of your body. Especially in later life, this knowledge provides first aid information for
    avoiding muscular injury and detecting even minimal and mild strain injuries. Once a strain appears to have healed,
    Opti-stretch can detect whether a partially injured muscular problem remains. Third, if due to illness or other
    conditions a problem with risk factors does occur, improved toning of the muscles can help an individual to avoid
    significant strains to those muscles.

<h3>WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF ACTIVITY LEVEL?</h3>

<p>
    Activity level is an important concept in assessing back health but is very difficult to quantify scientifically.
    The minimum independent functioning of an individual are defined as the Activities of Daily Living
    (<strong><em>ADL</em></strong>). Individuals with “bad backs” due to “recurrent back strain syndromes” will
    experience very few back strains if this activity level is <u>strictly</u> maintained. However, if their situation
    in life changes to where they are required to maintain a higher activity level, the ACIMs will frequently become
    reinjured.
</p>

<p>
    Even blue-collar workers who can lift significant amounts of weight all day without difficulty can still have ACIMs
    and serious risk factors for back strain. If they change jobs to where lifting from uneven surfaces and twisting
    while lifting is required, they often find their “recurrent back strain” will flair up.
</p>

<p>
    Testing of the back for strength and conditioning can be done but is very problematic and potentially dangerous for
    certain age groups. Currently, there is no excellent scientific gold standard of activity level measurement. The
    general concept of “run, jump, climb, work, play and keep up with the other kids your age”, is a valuable concept.
    Opti-stretch stretching exercises appear to be an excellent way of predicting a healthy back.

<h3>
    SHOULD EVERYONE ACHIEVE THE OPTI -STRETCH “GOLD STANDARD” LEVEL OF RANGE-OF-MOTION?
</h3>

<p>
    The “gold standard” level of tone allows excellent general function of the core muscles. Toning beyond that level
    does not appear to significantly improve back health. If you were a healthy 3 to 5 year old, you once possessed this
    range of motion. (That is why the majority of individuals can obtain this level with a sufficient amount of effort
    over a 6-month period of time.)
</p>

<p>
    Remember, many world class athletes with very healthy backs have range of motion somewhat less than the “gold
    standard”. However, they are usually very symmetrical. Also, they are usually very close to the “gold standard”.
    There are certain body types that can have a fairly limited range of motion, yet have very healthy backs. The
    concept is valuable for those with severe recurrent back problems to set realistic goals and be able to recognize
    when the back pain is due to a cause other than muscle strain.
</p>

<p>
    Remember these are basic guidelines. The optimum range of motion is partially genetically determined and is
    dependent on multiple factors. Optimum tone of your own muscles is the most important goal no matter what your range
    of motion. Tone is defined as a measured amount of range of motion beginning from the “first sensation of stretch”
    given a certain quantity of force and not exceeding a certain level of discomfort. Optimum is somewhere between too
    little and too much. Without scientific measuring devices, stretched range of motion is currently one of the better
    indicators of tone. Hopefully, in the near future, we will be able to more accurately determine what is the “normal”
    range of motion for a specific body type. Opti-stretch has contributed to this goal in being able to easily screen
    for double-jointed individuals and genetic hyperflexibility.
