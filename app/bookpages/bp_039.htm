    <p>a. &nbsp;Place the hands behind the head and gently lower the chin toward the chest. Notes: This is usually an
        easy stretch for most individuals.</p>

    <p>Risk factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the chin does not come within one inch of the chest, this is a risk factor.</li>
        <li>If tightness is felt in back of the neck on one side more significantly than the other, this is a risk
            factor.
