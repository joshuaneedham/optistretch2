<h3>22. “DR. MOM”</h3>

<p>
    The largest numbers of primary care providers in the world are affectionately referred to as “Dr. Mom”. They are the
    first to evaluate the sprained ankles and strained backs. They either treat or refer to the medical doctor. The
    advice for mild back strains from the average mother “Dr. Mom” has always been to give a back strain a little rest
    and avoid lifting any heavy objects. After a period of time to heal the injury, they advise gradually working
    oneself back to normal activity and to
    <u>be more careful</u>
    the next time. Modern medicine has come full circle. In the 1960’s and early 70’s, most patients with severe common
    back pain were hospitalized and placed in bed rest with continuous traction. This proved neither medically
    beneficial nor cost effective. Today, medical therapy significantly concurs with the age-old advice of “Dr. Mom”.
    Extensive medical data shows that the majority of common back pain cases will get better in one to two months
    regardless of whether physical therapy, chiropractic medicine or no treatment at all is employed. It appears that
    nothing will consistently hasten the normal healing process of a severe back strain.

<p>
    Until Opti-stretch, there hasn’t been a good precise plan for gradually working oneself back to 100% activity or
    even knowing when full activity should be tried. With Opti-stretch, you will know your range of motion before the
    injury. Once this same range of motion is comfortably
    achieved, the muscles are ready to strengthen and condition. Upon completing these three steps, 100% activity is
    usually safe. More importantly, if a child or young adult cannot comfortably reach their before-injury range of
    motion, then 100% effort in activity level is not advisable.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch has also been designed particularly for “Dr. Mom”, with regards to posture problems. In the past, their
    only advice for posture problems was to
    <u>repetitively</u>
    tell their child to “<u><b>stand up straight</b></u>”. Now there exists a better way. With the Opti-stretch screening program, they can actually demonstrate if there
    are any asymmetries in the muscular function of their child’s back. By encouraging the relatively simple
    Intermediate Therapeutic Program, many of the postural problems can be improved. If certain goals are achieved and
    the problem still exists, a formal medical consultation may be indicated.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most exciting prospects is the routine testing on a periodic basis using the Advanced Program. By
    starting at “3 to 5” years of age, Dr. Moms might be able to help ensure that their child can obtain a good solid
    range of motion for virtually any activity that the child desires throughout adolescence. Those individuals that
    have preserved this range of motion into adulthood and even older age, are generally more active and have better
    health.
</p>

<p>
    In the past, many children would try extremely hard “to excel” in sports. However, due to the fact that they had
    tight muscles or chronically injured muscles, they had to work twice as hard as the other kids. Also, they were the
    ones most likely to sustain injuries. This unfortunately can lead to decreased interest in an active lifestyle as
    the adolescent matures.
</p>

<p>
    The most exciting goal is the potential for decreasing the epidemic of back pain. Every “Dr. Mom” knows directly or
    indirectly someone who suffers from some type of back pain. In the United States, it is a serious and incapacitating
    epidemic. Opti-stretch does not protect against every type of back pain. However, statistically, these other types
    of pathologic back pain account for less than 15% of the individuals who suffer from back pain.
</p>

<p>
    Opti-stretch is designed only for common back pain due to strained muscles. However, the statistical probability
    that an adolescent or young adult will experience some type of noticeable muscular back strain is extremely high.
    Those who are able to establish and then preserve optimal muscle tone to the core muscles of the spine, two things
    generally occur. First, the severity of muscle strains tends to decrease. Second, the chances of various recurrent
    back pain syndromes are significantly decreased. A
    <u>major goal</u>
    of Opti-stretch is to decrease “recurrent back pain syndromes” in our children’s lifetime.
</p>

<p>
    Asymmetric muscle tightness is a risk factor and significantly increases the chance of injury to muscles of the
    spine. In my experience as a practicing physician and doing sports physicals, only 10 to 20% of primary school
    children had potentially correctable muscle tightness of some type. About 20-40% of middle school teenagers had this
    type of problem. By high school over 50-70% of the students had asymmetric muscle tightness. Note that these
    individuals examined were primarily the “athletes” of the school. The younger the child, the more rapidly tight
    muscles can be corrected. The optimum time is while the bones are still growing and shaping (usually before age 18).
</p>

<p>
    Protection and prevention are very realistic goals for “Dr. Mom” to implement using the Opti-stretch program. (Also
    a word of advice, it’s always better for Dr. Mom to demonstrate to the child the exercises rather than to simply
    just teach them.)
    <u>Other goals and benefits include</u>:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Protect against back injury.</li>
	<li>Protect against reinjury to an already injured muscle while it is healing.</li>
	<li>To be able to determine when an injured muscle is healed and ready for full activity.</li>
	<li>Prepare adolescents for the “weekend warrior syndrome”.</li>
	<li>Tone muscles.</li>
	<li>Shape muscles.</li>
	<li>Improve posture.</li>
	<li>Screen for problems in children who are not performing in sports as well as expected, given the amount of effort
	    and practice.</li>
	<li>Retain a child-like mobility for life.</li>
</ol>
