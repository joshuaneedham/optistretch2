<p>
    Opti-stretch is an exciting new program designed to reduce or eliminate the recurrence rate of back pain in millions
    of individuals caused specifically by a <u>strain injury</u> to the muscles. Many stretching programs have evolved
    which have shown to help back strain in certain individuals. Opti-stretch optimizes the number of stretches needed,
    the breathing technique required and other essential techniques that changes stretching to a stretch receptor
    lengthening program. This allows optimal toning of muscles, which is the first step for later strengthening and
    conditioning muscles in order to return the muscles to a completely healthy state. Trying to strengthen poorly toned
    muscles is often fraught with recurrent injury to the muscles.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, it was not designed for all types of back pain. It is well documented that approximately 80% of the
    Western populations will have at least one significant episode of back pain in their lifetime. What isn’t well
    documented, is what happens after the first significant back strain. Having interviewed thousands of individuals,
    there appears to be two very distinct courses of this problem. Approximately half of these individuals will, after
    1-2 episodes, be able to return to their previous activity level and are considered to have regained a strong back.
    The other half will develop a syndrome of dozens to hundreds of recurrent back pain episodes in the exact same
    location. Many find that with decreasing their activity level or decreasing the weight that they lift, they are able
    to cope with the problem and can function in a relatively pain free state. Either consciously or subconsciously they
    are <u>constantly</u> aware that if certain activity levels are exceeded, the chance of re-injury to that precise
    area of the back is extremely high.
</p>

<p>
    In youth, this is rarely a clinically significant problem because of the months or years between recurrent episodes.
    However, conscious or subconscious awareness of limits to their activity level can have an impact on their athletic
    development and choice of the activity levels that they will choose as an adult. Seldom is back strain seen much
    before the age of 8-12. This usually falls in the mild to moderate strain categories. The first occurrence of a
    <strong><em>severe</em></strong> strain is most frequently seen in the early 20’s of an individual. Past the age of
    35, this type of injury can become a serious recurrent problem. Each significant re-injury often requires an even
    lower activity level to avoid re-injury. Because back pain is commonly recurrent, many people are either forced to
    battle with it in order to gain higher activity levels or simply cope with it. By age 45-55 the recurrent injury
    rate can become so frequent, there are seldom any long periods of relief. In this form, it is similar to other
    long-term incapacitating diseases.
</p>

<p>
    When I decided to “leave no stone unturned” in my search to improve my own back problems, I began by studying
    <u>every</u>
    discipline dealing with back pain. After hundreds of hours investigating the D’s, (Doctors of Medicine,
    Chiropractic, Osteopathy and Naturopathy), I covered A to Z from Acupuncture to Yoga. At the same time I interviewed
    approximately 2000 people and asked them just to talk about their experience with back pain (or lack thereof).
    Individuals who had been diagnosed with low back strain and who had at least 2 recurrences in the exact same
    location were my main focus. Those individuals who described a type of victory over recurrent back pain were
    especially informative. It became apparent that disciplines successful in helping at least some individuals out of
    the vicious cycle of recurrent back pain, dealt with a concept referred to as
    <u>movement therapy</u>. There appeared to be at least three types of movement therapy. These types of movement
    therapy include self-movement by the patient (i.e., exercise, walking, or some activity), direct movement by the
    practitioner (i.e., Physical Therapy and Osteopathy) and indirect movement where another part of the body is moved
    (manipulated) to improve the injury (i.e., Chiropractic).
</p>

<p>
    Strain injuries to muscles commonly result in tissue damage (bruising and microscopic damage to the muscle cells).
    When a muscle perceives pain either from direct injury or even indirectly from other structures in the skeletal
    system, the muscle goes into a <u>protective spasm state</u>. The amount of spasm is dependent on the severity of
    injury. This spasm protects the area from movement to allow healing. The healing process is a gradual increasing
    (lengthening) of pain free motion. Significantly injured muscles will continue to heal by a gradual process over
    days, weeks, or even months. The pain free range of motion gradually increases to a level that is functional and
    appears quite normal for most activities. For most individuals, when they can again do most activities without the
    muscle bothering them, the strain is considered healed. However, in this functional state, the muscle has often not
    returned to its previous level of health. In a completely healthy state the muscle must have sufficient tone,
    strength and conditioning. If the muscle does not completely regain the proper tone (normal range of motion) it is
    very difficult to properly strengthen and condition the muscle to the same level prior to injury.
</p>

<p>
    This type of muscle with a chronic injury is referred to as an <u>asymptomatic chronically injured muscle (ACIM)</u>.
    The classic presentation of this type of injury is a previously strained muscle that for all practical purposes
    appears to have returned to normal. However, when the muscle is carefully assessed, it is somewhat tighter (less
    range of motion). The muscle will typically have 1 1&frasl;2 2 inches or more of decreased range of motion. The
    muscle is noticeably more tender to touch and often develops “knots” (trigger points) compared to the same muscle on
    the other side of the body. Also the <u>transition range</u> of stretch-to-discomfort-to-pain is noticeably
    different. These asymptomatic chronically injured muscles (<strong><em>ACIMs</em></strong>) can exist in this state
    for up to decades until some type of movement therapy finally returns the muscle to an improved level of muscle
    tone.
</p>

<p>
    Every form of movement therapy that I could find was thoroughly evaluated. While researching the field of Yoga, I
    stumbled upon several stretching exercise programs claiming to cure back pain and prevent it from recurring. Each of
    these stretching programs was studied in depth. Stretching exercises have long been a tool for Physical Therapy and
    a home treatment activity by the majority of medical professions. While various stretching exercises constitute a
    recommended treatment, there is no one set of exercises that is considered significantly better than another.
</p>

<p>
    Several recent scientific studies comparing Chiropractic, Physical Therapy and no treatment at all have shown there
    is no currently known way to shorten healing of a <u>severe</u>
    back strain. Of these three types of therapy, none could shorten the 1 to 2 months that it normally takes the
    average severely strained back to heal. This suggests that the solution to the problem is not in shortening the
    healing process but preventing it from recurring again. Some type of movement therapy appeared to be the key. All
    the programs studied, claimed some successes in returning the injured back again to a healthy state.
</p>

<p>
    Stretching and specific exercise routines had always worked for my back in the past. However, with a fourth <u>severe</u>
    injury to the low back and increasing age, there seemed to be a definite limit of physical activity, which I
    couldn’t get beyond despite stretching and exercise.
</p>

<p>
    To develop the Opti-stretch program over 350 different stretching exercises published in various books and magazines
    were then evaluated. A practical number of very specific stretching exercises were chosen that could be used daily
    and that isolated specific muscles of the back that were commonly prone to injury. A few new stretching exercises
    had to be designed. Most active individuals who had <u>never experienced any back pain</u> were able to comfortably
    perform the stretching exercises. However, individuals from the recurrent back pain group consistently had
    difficulty in comfortably performing the exercises symmetrically. New scientific theories were formulated to help
    explain why some stretching programs seemed to work better than others. The scientific theories also offer an
    explanation why some individuals achieve better results.
</p>

<p>
    The stretching exercises target very specific muscles of the spine (referred to as the <u>core muscles</u>). Certain
    specific muscles were found to be reinjured time and time again. Sometimes the re-injury would be weeks to months
    apart. Commonly, these injuries could be several years apart. Stretching exercises were specifically designed to
    stretch and tone certain essential core muscles. One of the stretching exercises has even been used for over 2000
    years. The stretching exercises are simply a tool for movement therapy. The theories, concepts and practical
    applications behind the stretches are what contribute to the success in the Opti-stretch program.
</p>

<p>
    The major goal of Opti-stretch is to allow you personally to “run, jump, work and play with the other kids your
    age”. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a kid 6 or 60 years of age. The youngest age where certain risk factors could
    definitely be demonstrated was at 3 1&frasl;2 years of age. If tight, tender muscles (ACIMs) can be detected,
    Opti-stretch therapeutic stretching techniques have shown to lengthen the range of motion of the muscle by at least
    1-2 inches in average healthy individuals. Over months, muscles have a visco-elastic property that allows the range
    of motion of the muscle to actually stretch further through a process referred to as <u>stretch receptor
    lengthening</u>. This process tones the muscle and allows for an increased level of movement and activity.
</p>

<p>
    Even non-limber individuals in their 40’s have been able to regain a similar level of range of motion as a <u>“3 to
    5 year old child”</u>. Over 95% of all healthy 3 to 5 year olds have a very similar range of motion, referred to as
    the <u>“gold standard”</u> range of motion. Over this age, especially in the female population, range of motion can
    significantly increase. Opti-stretch has demonstrated that with the proper technique and work, even 40 year olds can
    develop the same level of movement that they enjoyed as a 3 to 5 year old child. If at first glance the stretches
    seem way too difficult, it most likely means that you are one of the individuals who could benefit most from
    increasing your range of motion on the tighter muscles by at least 1 to 2 inches. Keep in mind there are some
    individuals in their 70’s who can easily perform all of the Opti-stretch stretching exercises to the level of the
    “gold standard”. Their own activity level has maintained this level of movement throughout their life. Their
    activity level is in the top 10% for their given age group. They are also frequently in the 20% of the population
    that have <u>never had any back pain</u>.
</p>

<p>
    For individuals with documented risk factors, upon completion of Step I and Step II of the Opti-stretch program,
    they could not only increase comfortably their range of motion but recurrent episodes of strain significantly
    decreased either in number or severity. For those who were able to complete the program to the level of the “gold
    standard” and to both strengthen and condition the muscles that had risk factors, the recurrent injury in that
    precise location was effectively eliminated. Consistent hard work for 20 minutes a day for 2-6 months is not easy.
    Using a goal oriented approach to track progress proved to be a significant motivating factor.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, Opti-stretch doesn’t work for everyone with recurrent back strain. Individuals, with certain types of
    joint pain, joint injury or chronic soft tissue injury, sometimes cannot comfortably generate a sufficient amount of
    stretch to the muscles, without producing a sensation of pain, which results in reflex muscle spasm or injury. The
    muscles will then go into a protective state of partial spasm making toning of the muscle either slow or impossible.
    It is better to start Opti-stretch when you are age 5 rather than age 65. Opti-stretch was designed for healthy
    individuals without any medical conditions. Individuals over age 35 need a doctor’s consent.
</p>

<p>
    For those who are sufficiently healthy to participate in the Opti-stretch program, a series of specific “Challenges”
    are included to help in effectively and safely obtaining their goals. No one yet has obtained the “gold standard”
    level without significantly improving the problems with their back, if indeed the problem was due to muscle strain.
