	<ol type="a">
		<li>In the cheerleader position with the back leg fully extended, grab either the right ankle or knee with the left
    hand.</li>
		<li>Controlling the weight of the upper body with the arms, slowly allow the right knee and left shoulder to touch.
    (Knee to the cross shoulder).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is designed to stretch all the 6 hip flexor muscles of which the pyriformis is the one most commonly recognized.</li>
		<li>By putting the left hand beneath the right knee and gently pulling, you may place extra stretch on the hip flexor
    muscles.</li>
		<li>Occasionally, return to the “Supine Knee to Cross Chest” and “Sitting Knee to Cross Chest” to assure all the hip
    flexors are being sufficiently stretched.</li>
