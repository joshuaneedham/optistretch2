	<u>Again</u>, don’t stretch an <u>acutely injured muscle</u>. Give the muscle at least 2 to 5 days before gradually resuming gentle stretching exercises. Moderate strains may need 5 to 7 days or more. Only at a certain point in the healing phase will acutely injured muscles respond to stretching techniques. Daily stretching can actually prolong the healing phase due to daily irritation of the acute injury (like picking off a scab). Don’t worry about lost progress.
