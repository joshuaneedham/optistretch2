    Certain basic concepts and principles need to be understood to insure optimum results and prevent injury. In order
    to achieve this, specific definitions to the sometimes-confusing terminology of back pain are provided below.

<h3>CLASSIFICATIONS OF BACK PAIN VS. RECURRENT BACK STRAIN</h3>


<p>
    In order to understand “recurrent back strain”, it is important to see how it compares to all types of back pain.
    Because “recurrent back strain” is new to many, a description of the criteria used to determine various types of
    injury are presented. Remember, only a doctor can determine for sure that you have a muscle strain and not something
    more serious.

<h3>BACK PAIN</h3>
<p>
    Back pain is a commonly misunderstood term. Back pain is composed of several different types.
</p>

<p>
    20% of the population statistically have
    <u>never had any back pain</u>. Interviewing and studying the range of motion of this group of individuals was
    invaluable in formulating many of the goals and concepts of Opti-stretch.

<p>
	<b>80% – Have had at least one episode of significant back pain.</b>
</p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
	<li>15% – Malignant (occurring in severe form and commonly referred to as pathologic). Spine fractures, herniated
    discs, infection, tumor, etc. There are approximately 25 to 30 different pathologic disease processes, each that
    have a very specific form of therapy. Usually arthritic and chronic persistent back pain problems are in this group.</li>
	<li>85% – Benign. Benign back pain is also sometimes referred to as common back pain. It is usually diagnosed as a
    muscle strain or fascial (soft tissue and ligament strain) which is most commonly referred to as myofascial strain.
    The majority of time it is associated with lifting a heavy object or twisting while lifting. It is a clinical
    diagnosis and no x-rays or blood tests can more specifically diagnose the muscle or tissue involved. Commonly the
    only form of therapy is rest and reassurance it will get better on its own.</li>
	<li>&gt;50% – Heal fine and do not reoccur.</li>
	<li>? % – A significantly large number of these individuals religiously avoid the same level of activity that caused
		the initial injury.</li>
	<li>&lt;30% – <u>Recurrent back pain</u>. Individuals in this group have at least 2 or more reoccurrences of nearly identical pain
    in the exact same place. In the more problematic form of the disease, individuals can have 100’s to even 1000’s of
    reoccurrences (at different severity levels). Commonly, re-injury occurs at a certain activity level threshold
    (i.e., amount of weight lifted). However, in certain individuals re-injury can occur by simply taking a step wrong
    or during a mild twisting motion. Each reoccurrence (especially severe and moderate) can noticeably lower the
    activity level threshold at which the pain will reoccur. The most common form of therapy is decreasing the activity
    level to a progressively lower level (at least for a few months). This form of recurrent back strain affects at
    least 20-50 million people in the USA alone.
