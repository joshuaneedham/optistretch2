    <h2>ASSESSMENT OF<br>SCREENING TESTS</h2>

    The Opti-stretch Beginning and Intermediate Screening Tests evaluate for risk factors. Determination that certain
    anatomical risk factors for recurrent back pain actually existed was the second most important discovery in
    Opti-stretch research. The most important discovery was that risk factors could be corrected in order to regain a
    healthy back.

<p>
    In my 23-year battle with recurrent back strain, I had input from the very best physicians in America. However, I
    intuitively knew that there had to be something that was different with me compared with the majority of my friends.
    With increasing age and traveling to multiple geographic regions of the USA and other countries, I started
    encountering a handful of friends with the same desire for high activity levels who had exactly the same recurrent
    back strain pattern that I did. They too, after each back strain were told to go home, rest, gradually increase
    activity levels, and their backs would get better. For a time, yes, this would indeed occur. However, inevitably
    something would come along, to restrain that precise area of their backs. Like me, they simply lived with the
    problem. Many were MDs, who had reverted to seeing alternative medicine physicians for this recurrent medical
    problem.

    Risk factors are anatomical differences that an individual can actually see for themselves. Because of the very
    precise reproducibility of these differences and the ability to accurately measure them, these anatomical parameters
    can be followed and correlated with having a healthy back or not. Finally, I could actually see something different
    in me compared with those having healthy backs. This allowed me to correct the problem.

    Presented in this book are only the simplified basics of risk factor assessment. Each “recurrent back pain syndrome”
    has a very characteristic pattern of several groups of muscles with ACIMs, which can then exhibit varying degrees of
    chronic injury spasm. Moreover, each syndrome has multiple normal variants. An entire book could be devoted to this
    one subject alone. This is in part due to the complexity of anatomical variations in the various human races.
    Currently, there are 18 different genetic anatomical variations of just the psoas muscle complex, which incidentally
    consists of only 3 muscles. It is currently believed that the anatomical variations do not cause the back pain.
    However, should an injury occur, certain anatomical variations are more susceptible to forming “recurrent back
    strain syndromes”. (See Section II – Scientific Considerations #14. The Psoas Muscle.)</b>

<p>
    As mentioned previously, just because certain risk factors are present does not mean you will have back pain. The
    ability to comfortably perform certain of the Advanced
</p>

<p>
    Program stretches (i.e., Standing Squat), seems to allow a great deal of protection from developing the initial
    significant low back strain.
</p>

<p>
    An Opti-stretch Therapeutic Program should be strongly considered if any of the following could be demonstrated
    during the screening exams:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>1. risk factors (as described for each individual exercise)</li>
    <li>2. unequal range of motion – (asymmetry )</li>
    <li>3. very limited range of motion</li>
</ol>
<p>
    For the 20% of the population with no risk factors, no asymmetry and good range of motion, these fortunate
    individuals need to simply record their range of motion. This information could be extremely valuable if a severe
    accident or injury were to occur. These individuals should consider repeating the screening test periodically. This
    can be either every 6 months or annually.
</p>

<p>
    Remember that Opti-stretch is designed for <u>primary</u> chronically injured muscles (ACIMs). However, it may be
    helpful in certain forms of <u>secondary</u>
    chronically injured muscles. It was not designed for treating acute injuries or acute reinjuries. In the early
    stages of acute injury, the inflammatory stage can even be prolonged with Optistretch. Chronically injured muscles
    and mild acute injuries can often feel very similar. If you are having muscle pain or even mild discomfort at rest,
    there may be an acute injury process going on. Once you have learned the Opti-stretch technique, it can be helpful
    in acute injury situations after the muscle has <u>healed</u> for a specific period of time (roughly 2 days).
    Discussion of time periods for various strains is found in Step
    #2 of the Opti-stretch Challenge and in the Scientific Considerations section.
</p>

<p>
    Something must happen to initially cause the first significant injury. The majority of the time this is most
    commonly due to lifting a heavy object. In acute reinjury, often very subtle forces can cause the reinjury. Take for
    example a mild acute reinjury to the muscle. Most commonly, there is a sensation of a pulled muscle or pain at the
    time of injury. However, quite often, the pain will not occur until you wake up the following morning. This
    represents two different severity’s of acute injury. Different severity’s of injury take different times to heal. As
    a general rule of thumb, you should be at least 2 months out from any acute injury before performing the screening
    tests or learning the Opti-stretch technique,
    <u>even with mild injuries</u>. Also, a medical doctor should reevaluate any pain lasting more than 2 months and not
    following a normal healing pattern. However, once you have initially learned the program this type of mild injury
    can usually receive benefit from gentle Opti-stretch stretching exercise after a couple of days rest.
