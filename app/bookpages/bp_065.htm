<h3>2. CONTRACTION VS. SPASM</h3>

<p>
    In science, the more that is understood about a problem, the better are the chances of a solution. Many times
    demonstrating theories to be wrong can be very beneficial when trying to solve very complex scientific problems. In
    the following sections, mainstream theories are simply presented as generally accepted scientific fact. Opti-stretch
    theories are clearly indicated so you will know these are still only theories. Other published theories are included, which
    for one reason or another have not been perpetuated in mainstream scientific literature.

    Muscles are part of the musculo-skeletal organ system. Their physiology and function are very complex. As an organ,
    it is one of the few organs of the body that have two completely opposite functions. The first function is to
    contract and
    <u>provide movement</u>
    of the body. The second function is to spasm and specifically
    <u>prevents movement</u>
    of the body. This spasm or injury response is the same whether there is direct injury to the muscle or indirectly
    caused by pain stimuli from surrounding structures like joints, ligaments and bone.

    During mild injury, an
    <u>agonistic</u>
    muscle will usually undergo partial spasm. When moderate injury occurs, not only the agonistic muscle but also the
    <u>accessory</u>
    muscles that serve the same function as the agonistic muscle will spasm. During a severe injury, like a broken femur
    (thighbone) of an animal, the
    <u>antagonist</u>
    muscles will also spasm. Simultaneous spasm of the primary muscles of movement, their accessory muscles, and the
    antagonistic muscles provide complete immobilization of the bone or joint. This complete immobilization allows for
    healing. If allowed to move, a broken bone will often not heal or will calcify in two separate pieces rather than
    one. This obviously is a serious complication. After sufficient healing of the bone, the majority of the time the
    muscles will gradually return to their normal function for movement of the limbs, especially where a muscle crosses
    only one joint. However, in certain core muscles, which can travel over 7 to 8 joints, there is an increased risk of
    chronic injury to those muscles.
